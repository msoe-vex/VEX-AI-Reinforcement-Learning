Overview
The VEX V5 Robotics Competition
Section 1 - Introduction
This section provides an introduction to the VEX V5 Robotics Competition (V5RC) and V5RC Push Back.
The world around us is constantly changing, and so are the ways we learn. Traditional classroom 
methods don’t always capture the hands-on problem solving and collaboration that are essential in 
STEM fields. Competitive robotics provides an alternative approach—one that engages students 
in real-world applications of engineering, coding, and design. Instead of just reading about these 
concepts, you get to experience them firsthand as you test ideas, refine solutions, and work as part 
of a team to overcome challenges. By combining creativity with technical skills, the VEX V5 Robotics 
Competition helps make STEM learning more dynamic, practical, and inspiring.
Competitive robotics isn’t just about building a robot—it’s about learning to approach challenges 
with confidence, resilience, and teamwork. The same problem-solving mindset that helps you design 
and refine a VEX robot is the foundation for tackling real-world engineering problems, scientific 
breakthroughs, and technological innovations. Push Back is more than just a game—it’s an opportunity 
to develop skills that will shape the problem solvers and innovators of tomorrow.
Working together with other people—whether it be your own teammates or someone from another 
organization—can be challenging, but it’s just as much a part of the VEX V5 Robotics Competition as 
building a robot. 
Within this manual, you’ll find the rules that define Push Back. These rules are designed to create a 
competitive yet fair environment that rewards creativity, strategy, and collaboration. Just like in the real 
world, constraints exist to challenge you—not to limit your potential, but to inspire innovative solutions.  
As you embark on this season, remember that every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Whether 
you’re fine-tuning your design, refining your strategy, or working through unexpected setbacks, the 
lessons you learn here will stay with you far beyond the competition field.  
Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your creativity and innovation in action!
Sincerely,
The VEX Robotics Game Design Committee, composed of members from VEX Robotics, the Robotics 
Education & Competition Foundation, and DWAB Technology

VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
V5RC Push Back: A Primer
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back is played on a 12’x12’ square Field, set up as illustrated in the 
figures throughout.
In Head-to-Head Matches, two (2) Alliances—one (1) “red” and one (1) “blue”—composed of two (2) 
Teams each, compete in Matches consisting of a fifteen (15) second Autonomous Period followed by a 
one minute and forty-five second (1:45) Driver Controlled Period.
The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Blocks in Goals, 
Controlling zones within Goals, clearing Loaders, and Parking in defined zones at the end of the Match.
An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any Alliance that completes a set of assigned tasks by the end 
of the Autonomous Period.
An Autonomous Bonus is awarded to the Alliance that has the most points at the end of the 
Autonomous Period.
Teams may also compete in Robot Skills Matches, where one (1) Robot tries to score as many points as 
possible. See Section 4 for more information.
At the VEX U collegiate level, Teams play in a modified tournament with a 30-second Autonomous 
Period and additional Robot build challenges. See Section 6.

About the Game Manual - A Note from the GDC
This Game Manual contains everything there is to know about this season’s game, V5RC Push Back. It is 
intended to be a resource for all Teams, Head Referees, Event Partners, and other members of the V5RC 
community.
The rules contained in the following pages can be thought of as “constraints” that define this game, 
just as engineers begin any design project by defining their constraints. At the beginning of a season, 
“constraints” are all we have. We don’t know what the winning Robot, best strategy, or most-frequently 
violated rule will be any more than you do. Isn’t that exciting?
When exploring a new game, please approach this Game Manual with that mentality of looking at rules 
as constraints. The Game Manual and its appendices—and the official Q&A on RobotEvents.com— 
contain the full and complete list of constraints that are available for competitors to strategize, design, 
and build their Robots.
Obviously, all Teams must adhere to these rules, and any stated intents of these rules. However, 
beyond that, there is no “right” way to play. There are no hidden restrictions, assumptions, or intended 
interpretations beyond what is written here. So, it is up to you, the competitor, to find the path through 
these constraints that best suits your Team’s goals and ambitions.

Our Intent - How We Want the Game Played
The Game Design Committee  (GDC) carefully designs each VEX Robotics Competition game with 
a clear vision of how we believe it should be played. The GDC envisions Push Back as a fast-paced 
game driven by constant back-and-forth action, where Teams must balance strategies to maintain 
control of Goals around the Field. Teams are encouraged to actively manipulate both their own and 
their opponents’ game pieces, creating dynamic shifts in scoring opportunities throughout the Match. 
Due to this continuous interaction, Offensive strategies should naturally be more effective than purely 
Defensive ones. At all times, there should be an open lane for a Robot to score into a Goal, ensuring 
that gameplay remains fluid and engaging. With a large quantity of Blocks available in both colors, no 
Team should ever be without access to their own game pieces. This design ensures that Teams remain 
focused on strategic decision-making, adaptability, and active gameplay rather than passive blocking 
or hoarding.
As the season progresses and Teams develop new strategies, certain aspects of gameplay may 
evolve in ways that were not initially anticipated. To ensure that the game remains fair, competitive, 
and aligned with its original intent, the GDC has identified key areas that may be subject to clarification 
or adjustment throughout the season. While updates are not limited to these areas, the GDC believes 
these are some of the most critical for maintaining the integrity of gameplay:
 ● No Possession Limit: The GDC has intentionally designed this game without a possession limit, 
as we believe such a restriction would hinder strategic play. However, we are mindful of potential 
exploitation, such as excessive hoarding of game objects. If it becomes clear that this is negatively 
impacting gameplay, we will consider implementing a possession limit. If a possession limit is 
implemented, the limited quantity could also be subject to future updates. Any updates to this 
quantity should not be more than 3-5 Blocks per update.
 ● Size of the Control Zone for Long Goals: The GDC may adjust the size of this zone if it is 
determined to be disproportionate to the flow of gameplay. Any change to this zone should be 
limited to no more than one Block size per update to ensure gradual, controlled adjustments.
 ● Goal Defense: The GDC intends for Matches to remain dynamic and offense-driven. While 
Defensive strategies are a natural part of gameplay, excessive Goal-tending or prolonged 
stalemates are not in the spirit of the game. If Defensive play becomes too dominant, the GDC will 
consider rule adjustments to incentivize more Offensive engagement.
Any potential adjustments would be made with the goal of ensuring that the game plays as intended for 
the duration of the season. While we will try our best to adhere to the self-imposed limits on change per 
update, we may make larger/broader changes if it is deemed absolutely necessary. Any updates will be 
communicated through official rule updates.

The Q&A System
When first reviewing a new robotics game, it is natural to have questions about situations which may 
not be immediately clear. Navigating the Game Manual and seeking out answers to these questions is 
an important part of learning a new game. In many cases, the answer may just be in a different place 
than you first thought—or, if there is no rule explicitly prohibiting a gameplay strategy, then that usually 
means it is legal!
However, if a Team is still unable to find an answer to their question after closely reviewing the relevant 
rules, then every Team has the opportunity to ask for official rules interpretations and clarifications 
in the VEX Robotics Question & Answer System . These questions may be posted by a Team’s Adult 
representative via the RobotEvents account that is associated with that Team.
All responses in this Q&A system should be treated as official rulings from the VEX Robotics Game 
Design Committee, and they represent the correct and official interpretation of the VEX V5 Robotics 
Competition rules. The Q&A system is the only source besides the Game Manual for official rulings and 
clarifications, and is functionally an extension of the Game Manual. Unlike Game Manual updates, Q&A 
rulings are effective immediately upon release.
The VEX V5 Robotics Competition Question & Answer System will open May 27th.
Before posting on the Q&A system, be sure to review the Q&A Usage Guidelines .
1. Read and search the manual before posting.
2. Read and search existing Q&As before posting.
3. Quote the applicable rule from the latest version of the manual in your question.
4. Make a separate post for each question.
5. Use specific and appropriate question titles.
6. Questions will (mostly) be answered in the order they were received.
7. This system is the only source for official rules clarifications.
During the 7-day grace period, the previous manual version will be available at https://link.vex.com/
docs/25-26/v5rc-pushback-manual-obsolete . This link will be only be active during the grace period 
following each manual update, and will be disabled once it ends.
The GDC reserves the right to enforce critical updates to the Game Manual as effective immediately 
upon release, if we feel that the changes are critical for competitive integrity, safety, and/or other 
extenuating circumstances.
Multi-week league events (or similar) that cross over a grace period should use the version of the Game 
Manual that is in effect at the beginning of each league session. Leagues should update to new versions 
of the Game Manual between sessions as appropriate.

If there are any conflicts between the English-language PDF of the Game Manual and other 
supplemental or translated materials (e.g., referee training materials, the V5RC Hub app, the game 
reveal video, a translated game manual, etc.), the most current version of the English-language PDF of 
the Game Manual takes precedence. 
Similarly, it can never be assumed that definitions, rules, or other materials from previous seasons apply 
to the current game. Q&A responses from previous seasons are not considered official rulings for the 
current game. Any relevant clarifications that are needed should always be re-asked in the current 
season’s Q&A.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
General Definitions
Adult - Anyone who is not a Student or another defined term (e.g., Head Referee). 
 
Alliance - A pre-assigned grouping of two (2) Robots that are paired together during a given Match. 
 
Alliance Station  - The designated regions where the Drive Team Members must remain for the duration of 
the Match. 
 
 
Autonomous Bonus - A point bonus awarded to the Alliance that has earned the most points at the end of 
the Autonomous Period. See <SC5> for more information. 
 
 
Autonomous Win Point (AWP) - An additional Win Point awarded to any Alliance that has completed a 
defined set of tasks at the end of the Autonomous Period of a Qualification Match . Both Alliances can earn 
an Autonomous Win Point if both Alliances accomplish these tasks. See <SC6> for more information. 
Defensive - A category of strategies, Robot actions, and/or Robot statuses that can be employed by a 
Team during a Match; see rules <GG14> and <GG15> for more information. A Robot is Defensive while it 
is engaged in actions that cannot increase its Alliance’s score for the current Match, and instead limits an 
opponent’s ability to score or play the game. A Robot can be in possession of a scoring object and capable 
of scoring, but still be Defensive based on its actions. Examples include, but are not limited to:
 ● De-scoring in a way that doesn’t increase points for the Robot’s own Alliance
 ● Limiting access to a portion of the Field while not attempting to score
 ● Holding, blocking, impeding, or otherwise restricting or controlling an opponent’s movements
 ● Goalkeeping
Remember, Defensive Robot actions or Robot statuses are not automatically Violations. 
However, Robot actions or statuses that are performed or achieved in a Defensive manner 
are more likely to be Violations, and Teams should be more careful when employing Defen-
sive strategies.
 
Disablement - A penalty applied to a Team for a safety Violation. A Team that receives a Disablement is not 
allowed to operate their Robot for the remainder of the Match, and the Drive Team Member(s) will be asked 
to place their controller(s) on the ground or another safe location outside of the Field, as directed by the 
Head Referee.
14
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Disqualification  - A penalty applied to a Team for a Major Violation. A Team that receives a Disqualification  
in a Qualification Match  receives zero (0) Win Points, (0) Autonomous Win Points, (0) Autonomous Points, 
and (0) Strength of Schedule Points . When a Team receives a Disqualification  in an Elimination Match, 
the entire Alliance is Disqualified and they receive a loss for the Match. At the Head Referee’s discretion, 
repeated Violations and/or Disqualifications  for a single Team may lead to its Disqualification  for the entire 
tournament (see <GG6>). A Team that receives a Disqualification  in a Driving Skills Match  or Autonomous 
Coding Skills Match  receives a score of zero (0) for that Robot Skills Match. 
 
 
Drive Team Member - A Student who stands in the Alliance Station during a Match. Adults are not allowed 
to be Drive Team Members. See rule <GG1>. 
 
 
Entanglement  - A Robot status. A Robot is Entangled if it has grabbed, hooked, or attached to an opposing 
Robot or a Field Element. See rule <GG14>.
Field - The entire playing Field, comprising of the Floor and the Field Perimeter. 
 
Field Element - The Field, white tape, Loaders, Goals, Park Zones, and all supporting structures and 
accessories (such as field monitors, etc.).  
 
 
Field Perimeter - The outer part of the Field, made up of 12 straight sections. 
 
 
Floor - The interior flat part of the playing Field, made up of an array of six (6) gray foam field tiles wide by 
six (6) gray foam field tiles long (totaling 36 field tiles) that are within the Field Perimeter. 
 
 
Game Design Committee (GDC)  - The creators of Push Back, and authors of this Game Manual. The GDC is 
the only official source for rules clarifications and Q&A responses; see Section 1.  
 
 
Holding - A Robot status; see rule <GG17> for more information. Holding is legal until it exceeds the limits in 
<GG17>. A Robot is considered to be Holding if it meets any of the following criteria during a Match:
 ● Trapping - Limiting the movement of an opponent Robot to a small or confined area of the Field, 
approximately the size of one foam field tile or less, without an avenue for escape. Note that if a Robot is 
not attempting to escape, it is not considered Trapped.
 ● Pinning - Preventing the movement of an opponent Robot through contact with the Field Perimeter, a 
Field Element, or another Robot.
 ● Lifting - Controlling an opponent’s movements by raising or tilting the opponent’s Robot off of the 
foam tiles. Preventing a Robot that is already off of the Floor from returning to the Floor may also be 
considered Lifting or Trapping.

Offensive - A category of strategies, Robot actions, and/or Robot statuses that can be employed by a 
Team during a Match; see rules <GG14> and <GG15> for more information. A Robot is Offensive while it 
is engaged in actions that could directly increase its Alliance’s score for the current Match. Examples 
include, but are not limited to:
 ● Adding an object to a Goal to score points
 ● Moving toward a Goal with an object that could earn points for their Alliance
 ● Changing the status of a Field Element or scoring object that acts as a multiplier or scoring bonus for 
their Alliance
 ● Achieving (or attempting to achieve) any Robot status that adds points to their Alliance’s score
 ● Obtaining (or attempting to obtain) scoring objects
Robot - A machine that has passed inspection, designed by Student Team members to execute one or 
more tasks autonomously and/or by remote control from a Drive Team Member. 
 
 
Student - A person is considered a Student if they meet both of the following criteria:
1. Anyone who is earning or has earned credit toward a secondary school (i.e., high school) diploma, 
certificate, or other equivalent during the six (6) months preceding the VEX Robotics World Champion -
ship. Courses earning credits leading up to high school would satisfy this requirement.
2. Anyone born after May 1, 2006 (i.e., who will be 19 or younger at VEX Worlds 2026). Eligibility may also 
be granted based on a disability that has delayed education by at least one year.
 ● Middle School Student  - A Student born after May 1, 2010 (i.e., who will be 15 or younger at VEX 
Worlds 2026). Any Students who meet this criteria may also compete as High School Students.
 ● High School Student  - Any eligible Student that is not a Middle School Student .
Team - One or more Students make up a Team. To participate in an official VEX V5 Robotics Competition 
event, a Team must first register on RobotEvents.com and receive a VEX V5 Robotics Competition Team 
number. A Team’s unique number identifies their organization and their Team within that organization. 
Each Team must build their own Robot, create their own code, and maintain their own Engineering 
Notebook if they choose to use one.
 ● A Team is classified as a Middle School Team if all members are Middle School Students .
 ● A Team is classified as a High School Team if any of its members are High School Students, or if the 
Team is made up of Middle School Students  who declare themselves “playing up” as High School 
Students by registering their Team as a High School Team.
 ● Once a Team has competed in an event as a High School Team, that Team may not change back to a 
Middle School Team for the remainder of the season. If a Team mistakenly registers as a Middle School 
Team but is ineligible for that age group, their registration may be revised mid-season with RSM assis -
tance; all prior qualifications for the season will be lost.
 ● Teams may be associated with schools, community/youth organizations, or groups of neighborhood 
Students.
17
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
In the context of this Game Manual, Teams include three types of Student roles related to Robot build, 
design, and coding. See <G2> and <G5> for more information. Adults may not fulfill any of these roles.
 ● Builder - The Student(s) on the Team who assemble(s) and repair(s) the Robot. Adults are permitted 
to teach the Builder(s) how to use concepts or tools associated with Robot construction, but should 
never work on the Robot.
 ● Coder - The Student(s) on the Team who write(s) the computer code that is downloaded onto the 
Robot. Adults are permitted to teach the Coder(s) how to use concepts or tools associated with 
programming, but should never work on the code that goes on the Robot.
 ● Designer - The Student(s) on the Team who design(s) the Robot. Adults are permitted to teach the 
Designer(s) how to use concepts or tools associated with design, but should never work on the 
design of the Robot.
 
Time Out - A single break period no greater than three minutes (3:00) allotted for each Alliance during 
the Elimination Bracket . See <GG7>. 
 
 
Violation - The act of breaking a rule in the Game Manual. 
 ● Minor Violation - A Violation which does not result in a Disqualification .
 ○ Accidental, momentary, or otherwise non Match Affecting Violations are usually Minor 
Violations.
 ○ Minor Violations  usually result in a verbal notification from the Head Referee during the Match, 
which should serve to inform the Team that a rule is being Violated before it escalates to a Major 
Violation.
 ● Major Violation - A Violation which results in a Disqualification .
 ○ Unless otherwise noted in a rule, all Match Affecting Violations are Major Violations.
 ○ If noted in the rule, egregious or strategic Violations or intentional actions that result in Viola-
tions may also be Major Violations.
 ○ Multiple Minor Violations  within a Match or tournament may escalate to a Major Violation at the 
Head Referee’s discretion or as specified in a rule. Minor Violations  carry over into Eliminations 
unless otherwise specified within a rule.
 ● Match Affecting - A Violation which changes the winning and losing Alliance in the Match.
 ○ Multiple Violations within a Match can cumulatively become Match Affecting.
 ○ When evaluating if a Violation was Match Affecting, Head Referees will focus primarily on any 
Robot actions that were directly related to the Violation.
 ○ Determining whether a Violation was Match Affecting can only be done once the Match is 
complete and the scores have been calculated.
18
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 ● CoC-related Violation  - A Violation of a rule that relates to the RECF Code of Conduct and related 
processes. For V5RC, VURC, and VAIRC, the included rules are: <S2>, <G1>, <G2>, <G4>, <G5>, <R1> 
through <R4>, and Major Violations of <S1>.
 ○ Potential CoC-related Violations  should be brought to the attention of the Event Partner, and 
resolved through the Code of Conduct Reporting Process in coordination with the Head Referee, 
Judge Advisor, and RECF Regional Support Manager. Follow-up investigations are conducted by 
the RECF Rules & Conduct Committee (RCC). Penalties for confirmed CoC-related Violations  can 
range from single-Match Disqualifications  to removal from the program.
 
Some rules include Violation Notes in red italicized text to denote special circumstances or provide 
additional clarifications. If no Violation Notes are found in a given rule, then it should be assumed that 
the above “default” definitions apply.
To determine whether a Violation may have been Match Affecting, check whether the Team who com-
mitted the Violation won or lost the Match. If they did not win the Match, then the Violation could not 
have been Match Affecting, and it was very likely a Minor Violation. 
See the flowcharts in figures V-1, V-2, and V-3 for more information, and this article for full details of the 
event CoC process.

Scoring
Autonomous Bonus 10 Points
Each Block Scored 3 Points
Each Controlled Zone in a Long Goal 10 Points
Controlled Center Goal - Upper 8 Points
Controlled Center Goal - Lower 6 Points
1 Parked Alliance Robot 8 Points
2 Parked Alliance Robots 30 Points
<SC1> All Scoring statuses are evaluated after the Match ends . Scores are calculated five (5) seconds 
after the Match ends, or once all Blocks, Field Elements, and Robots on the Field come to rest, whichever 
comes first.
a. This 5-second delay is intended to be the only permitted “benefit of the doubt” for last-second scoring 
actions. If an object or Robot is still in motion and “too close to call” between two states at the 5-second 
mark, then the less advantageous of the two states should be awarded to the Robot(s) in question. For 
example: 
i. A Robot which has Parked in a Park Zone but slowly droops down and is in contact with the top of the 
Field Perimeter at five (5) seconds would not be considered Parked.
ii. A Block which slowly falls out of a Goal at five (5) seconds would not be considered Scored.
b. At the end of the Match, the on-screen timer displayed by Tournament Manager will hold the current 
Match information and “0:00” for five (5) seconds before moving to queue the next Match. This should 
be the primary 5-second visual cue used by Teams and Head Referees.
c. This 5-second delay is only intended to be a “benefit of the doubt” grace period, not an extra five (5) 
seconds of Match time. Robots which are designed to strategically exploit this grace period will receive 
a Minor Violation, and any post-Match movement will not be included in score calculation (i.e., the Match 
will be scored as it was at 0:00).
d. Referees should avoid contacting or moving Robots and/or Blocks as much as possible while evaluating 
Scoring statuses. If an object must be moved to evaluate the status of another object, its status must be 
agreed upon by all Teams and the Head Referee, and noted or recorded, before it is moved.
e. Referees must record counts based on verified scoring statuses evaluated after the Match, using final 
positions of Blocks, Field Elements, and Robots. Point considerations used to determine whether a 
Violation is Match Affecting (e.g., specified in Violation Notes) should NOT be added to or deducted from 
the actual score, and points scored during a Violation should not be deducted from a score.
<SC2> A Block is considered Scored if it meets all of the following criteria:
a. The Block is in contact with the inside surface(s) of the clear plastic part of a Goal.
i. The edge faces of the clear plastic parts are not considered inside surfaces.
b. The Block is not in contact with a Robot of the same color as that Block.
c. The Block is not in contact with the Floor.

Figure SC2-1: This Block is touching the Floor, 
and would not be considered Scored.
Figure SC2-2:  The left (red) Block is not contacting the inside 
surface of the Goal, so it would not be considered Scored. The right 
(green) Block is contacting the inside surface of the Goal and is not 
touching a Robot of the same color, so it is considered Scored.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2737 - Edge-case examples of scored and not scored Blocks
Figure SC3-1: The left-most (red) Block is 
not fully within the tape lines marking the 
boundaries of the Control Zone , and therefore 
would not be considered in determining 
which Alliance  is in control of the Goal. The 
three other (green) Blocks are fully within 
the tape lines, and would be considered.
<SC3> A Control Zone is considered Controlled by an Alliance if a majority of the Blocks Scored in that 
Control Zone are the same color as the Alliance.
a. For Long Goals, a Scored Block is considered Scored in the Control Zone  if it is entirely contained within 
that Control Zone.
b. A Block must be considered Scored in a Goal (see <SC2>) to also be considered Scored in a Control Zone.

In most cases, if you can’t see a little bit of the next Block on the “inside” of the tape 
line (see figure SC3-2), the Block on that side of the Control Zone probably isn’t entirely 
contained within the Control Zone.
It’s not practical to examine every Block at a detailed level to decide whether it’s 
“entirely within” or not. If a Head Referee can’t definitively tell whether a Block is entirely 
contained within a Control Zone or not, that Block should be considered Scored in the 
Control Zone. Teams should not be invited into the Field to contribute opinions; this 
decision is up to the Head Referee.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2789 - The top surface of the Goal is the “tiebreaker” if there’s slight variance in 
the tape lines
 
<SC4> A Robot is considered Parked if it meets all of the following criteria:
a. The Robot is not contacting the Floor outside of its Alliance-colored Park Zone.
b. The Robot is not contacting any Field Elements other than the inside face of the Field Perimeter, the 
Floor inside of its Alliance-colored Park Zone, and/or the plastic extrusions and connectors that are 
part of the Park Zone. Contact with these allowed elements is not required.
c. The Robot is at least partially within the vertical projection of its Alliance-colored Park Zone.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2672 - Contact with Blocks doesn’t affect a Parked status
Figure SC3-2: The (green) Block on the 
right is fully within the tape boundaries, 
and would be considered as scored.

<SC5> Scoring of the Autonomous Bonus is evaluated immediately after the Autonomous Period ends 
(i.e., once all Blocks, Field Elements, and Robots on the Field come to rest). 
a. Points for Parked Robots are not included in the calculation of an Alliance’s score for the purposes 
of determining the Autonomous Bonus.
b. If the Autonomous Period ends in a tie, including a zero-to-zero tie, each Alliance will receive an 
Autonomous Bonus of five (5) points.
c. Any Violations, Major or Minor, committed during the Autonomous Period will result in the 
Autonomous Bonus being automatically awarded to the opposing Alliance. See <GG13>.
d. Per rule <GG13>, if both Alliances commit Violations during the Autonomous Period, then no 
Autonomous Bonus will be awarded.
 
 
<SC6>  An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any Alliance that ends the Autonomous Period with all 
of the following tasks completed, and that has committed no Violations during the Autonomous Period:
1. At least seven (7) Blocks of the Alliance’s color are Scored.
2. At least three (3) different Goals include at least one (1) Scored Block of the Alliance’s color.
3. At least three (3) Blocks of the Alliance’s color have been removed from Loaders adjacent to the 
Alliance’s Alliance Station.
4. Neither Robot is contacting the Park Zone barrier. 
Figure SC4-1: This Robot is at least partially within 
the vertical projection of their Alliance -colored Park 
Zone, and would be considered as Parked.
Figure SC4-2:  Both of these Robots would be considered 
as Parked, as they satisfy all the criteria listed above.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
For events which qualify directly to the World Championship (e.g., Event Region Championships and 
Signature Events), the following tasks must be completed for an Alliance to receive an Autonomous Win 
Point. The standard criteria above still apply to all other events.
1. At least ten (10) Blocks of the Alliance’s color are Scored.
2. At least three (3) different Goals include at least two (2) Scored Blocks of the Alliance’s color.
3. At least three (3) Blocks of the Alliance’s color have been removed from Loaders adjacent to the 
Alliance’s Alliance Station.
4. Neither Robot is contacting the Park Zone barrier. 
Autonomous Win Point criteria may be further modified for the World Championship if 
needed, with details to be released in a future Game Manual update.  
 
Autonomous Win Point criteria for World Championship-qualifying events will be used as 
a baseline to determine criteria for the World Championship. Any potential modifications 
will be minor, and will provide an increased challenge over the criteria listed above. For 
example, one possibility could be ”At least twelve (12) Blocks Scored,” instead of ten (10).
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG4>.

Safety Rules
<S1> Be safe out there. If at any time the Robot operation or Team actions are deemed unsafe or have 
damaged a Field Element, Block, or the Field, the offending Team may receive a Disablement and/or 
Disqualification  at the discretion of the Head Referee. The Robot will require re-inspection as described 
in rule <R3> before it may take the Field again. 
Violation Notes: Major Violations should be reported to and/or discussed with the Event Partner 
during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee 
following the event.
<S2> Students must be accompanied by an Adult.  No Student may attend a V5RC event without a 
responsible Adult supervising them. The Adult must obey all rules and be careful to not violate Student-
centered policies, but must be present for the full duration of the event in the case of an emergency. 
Violations of this rule may result in removal from the event.
Violation Notes: Violations should be reported to the Event Partner during the event, and should 
be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee following the event.
 
<S3> Stay inside the Field.  If a Robot is completely outside of the Field during a match, it will receive a 
Disablement for the remainder of the Match.
Note: The intent of this rule is not to penalize Robots for having mechanisms that inadvertently 
cross the Field Perimeter during normal game play.
 
<S4> Wear safety glasses.  All Drive Team Members must wear safety glasses or glasses with side 
shields while at the Field for Matches. While in the pit and queuing areas, it is highly recommended that 
all Team members wear safety glasses.
 
<S5> Each Student Team member must have a completed participant release form on file for the 
event and season. A Student Team member cannot participate in an event without a completed release 
form on file.

General Rules
<G1> Treat everyone with respect. All Teams are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful 
and professional manner while competing in VEX V5 Robotics Competition events. If a Team or any of 
its members (Students or any Adults associated with the Team) are disrespectful or uncivil to event 
staff, volunteers, or fellow competitors, they may receive a Disqualification  from a current or upcoming 
Match. Team conduct pertaining to <G1> may also impact a Team’s eligibility for judged awards. 
Repeated or extreme Violations of <G1> could result in a Team being Disqualified from an entire event, 
depending on the severity of the situation.
We all can contribute to creating a fun and inclusive event experience for all event 
attendees. Some examples include:  
 
When dealing with difficult and stressful situations, it is…
 ● Okay for Teams to be gracious and supportive when your Alliance partner makes a 
mistake.
 ● Not okay for Teams to harass, tease, or be disrespectful to your Alliance partner 
when a Match does not go your way.
When a Team does not understand a Match ruling or score, it is…
 ● Okay for Drive Team Members to consult with a Head Referee to discuss a ruling per 
the process outlined in <T3> in a calm and respectful manner.
 ● Not okay for Drive Team Members to continue arguing with the Head Referees after 
a decision has been finalized, or for Adults to approach a Head Referee with ruling/
scoring concerns.
When Teams are getting ready for an upcoming Match, it is…
 ● Okay for Teams in an Alliance to develop a game strategy that utilizes the strengths 
of both Robots to cooperatively play the game.
 ● Not okay for Teams in an Alliance to intentionally play beneath their abilities to ma -
nipulate the Match results.
This rule exists alongside the REC Foundation Code of Conduct. Violation of the Code of Conduct 
can be considered a Major Violation of <G1> and can result in Disqualification  from a current Match, 
an upcoming Match, an entire event, or (in extreme cases) an entire competition season. The Code of 
Conduct can be found here.
More information regarding the event Code of Conduct process can be found here.
a. Event attendees are not allowed to record audio or video of Teams’ discussions with Head Referees 
or other event staff/volunteers.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Violation Notes: Any Violations of <G1> may be considered Major Violations and should be addressed 
on a case-by-case basis. Teams at risk of a Major Violation of <G1> due to multiple disrespectful 
or uncivil behaviors will usually receive a “final warning,” although the Head Referee is not required 
to provide one. All Major <G1> Violations/Disqualifications  should be reported to and/or discussed 
with the Event Partner during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and 
Conduct Committee following the event.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2871 - Manipulating Match results by playing beneath your abilities can be a G1 
Violation, but isn’t in all cases
 
 
<G2> V5RC is a student-centered program.  Adults should not make decisions about the Robot’s build, 
design, or gameplay, and should not provide an unfair advantage by providing ‘help’ that is beyond the
Student’s independent abilities. Students must be prepared to demonstrate an active understanding of 
their Robot’s design, construction, and programming to judges or event staff. Students should build, design, 
and code the Robot with minimal Adult involvement.
Some amount of Adult mentorship, teaching, and/or guidance is an expected and encour -
aged facet of VEX competitions. No one is born an expert in robotics! However, obstacles 
should always be viewed as teaching opportunities, not problems for an Adult to solve for 
the Team.
When building or designing the Robot, it is…
 ● Okay for an Adult to help a Student consider why something failed, so it can be improved.
 ● Not okay for an Adult to provide step-by-step instructions or photos for the Student to 
copy.
When a mechanism falls off, it is…
 ● Okay for an Adult to help a Student consider why it failed, so it can be improved.
 ● Not okay for an Adult to investigate or put the Robot back together.
When a Team encounters a complex programming concept, it is…
 ● Okay for an Adult to guide a Student through a flowchart to understand its logic.
 ● Not okay for an Adult to write a premade command for that Student to copy/paste.
During Match play, it is…
 ● Okay for an Adult to provide cheerful, positive encouragement as a spectator.
 ● Not okay for an Adult to explicitly shout step-by-step commands from the audience.
This rule operates in tandem with the REC Foundation Student Centered Policy , which is available in the REC 
Library for Teams to reference throughout the season.
Violation Notes: Potential Violations of this rule will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. By defini -
tion, all Violations of this rule become Match Affecting as soon as a Robot which was built or coded 
by an Adult wins a Match. All reported and/or suspected <G2> Violations should be reported to the 
Event Partner during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct 
Committee following the event.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2676 - Adults should not provide an unfair advantage by helping Students create 
custom plastic parts
 
<G3> Use common sense. When reading and applying the various rules in this document, please remember 
that common sense always applies in the VEX V5 Robotics Competition. 
For example…
 ● If there is an obvious typographical error (such as “per <T5>” instead of “per <GG5>”), this 
does not mean that the error should be taken literally until corrected in a future update.
 ● Understand the realities of the VEX V5 Robot construction system. For example, if a 
Robot could hover above the Field for a whole Match, that would create loopholes in 
many of the rules. But... they can’t. So don’t worry about it.
 ● When in doubt, if there is no rule prohibiting an action, it is generally legal. However, if you 
have to ask whether a given action would violate <S1>, <G1>, or <T1>, then that’s probably 
a good indication that it is outside the spirit of the competition.
 ● In general, Teams will be given the “benefit of the doubt” in the case of accidental or 
edge-case rules infractions. However, there is a limit to this allowance, and repeated or 
strategic infractions will still be penalized.
 ● This rule also applies to Robot rules. If a component’s legality cannot be easily/intuitively 
discerned by the Robot rules as written, then Teams should expect additional scrutiny 
during inspection. This especially applies to those rules which govern non-VEX com -
ponents (e.g. <R19>, <R20>, <R23>, etc). There is a difference between “creativity” and 
“lawyering.” Basically, if there’s not a rule that makes a Robot part legal, it’s not allowed.
<G4> All work must represent the skill level of the Students on the Team. The Team’s design, Robot, 
coding, strategy, and ongoing work must represent the skill level of the Students currently on the Team.
a. Teams must avoid academic dishonesty and should not copy a Robot or mechanism that has been 
provided for them. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of instructions, pictures & videos, 
notebooks, CAD designs, and/or any other documentation useful to the design process provided by 
anyone that is not a Student on the Team (including Students on another Team).
b. Teams may be inspired by designs by other Teams, and use an idea from someone else to spark 
innovation, but are expected to document and demonstrate this in their engineering notebook alongside 
evidence of iteration. Teams are required to present this evidence if asked to do so by a Robot inspector, 
Head Referee, Event Partner, or Judge.
i. Using elements of another design as a starting point is acceptable if the Team is capable of 
demonstrating evidence of iteration, innovation, and/or modification that makes the design uniquely 
their own. Documentation should clearly demonstrate the idea that was used for inspiration, and 
how it was changed for the final implementation on the Team’s Robot. It should be clear that this final 
implementation is not an exact copy of ANY other original design.
ii. Failure to demonstrate evidence of iteration, innovation, and/or modification will result in a Violation.
34
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
c. Teams may use Robot plans and code (e.g., the annual Hero Bot, VEXcode configurations, etc.) provided 
by VEX Robotics or the RECF, but are encouraged to use these Robots, mechanisms, and code only as 
a starting point that Students modify, improve, or replace as their skills increase. Plans provided by VEX 
Robotics or the RECF are the only legal plans available for use in competition.
d. This rule still applies to Teams within the same school, organization, or club. Robots and/or code 
sets that are identical or substantially similar to one another across Teams within the same school/
organization/club will be considered in Violation of this rule, regardless of whether they compete in the 
same or different events. 
For more information, including acceptable and unacceptable examples of mechanical design, 
construction, coding, and strategy solutions, please refer to the Student Centered Policy in the RECF 
Library. 
The VEX Robotics Competition and the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation 
(RECF) recognize that many third-party individuals and organizations produce and distrib -
ute robot designs, instructions, and/or other materials that are not under our direct control. 
We cannot legally regulate or restrict the activities of these external entities. However, when 
Teams use these resources in ways that violate the spirit and letter of the VEX Robotics 
Game Manual—particularly Rules <G2> and <G4>—they undermine the core mission of the 
program: to provide Students with hands-on opportunities to learn, design, and innovate.
While it is never our intent to punish Students, we can legally regulate and restrict the activi -
ties of the Teams in our competitions, and we must preserve the fairness, educational value, 
and integrity of the competition. Therefore, Teams found to be in Violation of these rules will 
be held accountable to the strictest interpretations of <G2> and <G4>.
It is the responsibility of each Team to be able to explain and defend the design, construc -
tion, and programming of their Robot if questioned by referees, inspectors, Event Partners, 
or judges. Teams should be prepared to describe their design process, justify design deci -
sions, and demonstrate a full understanding of how their Robot and code function.
If a Team is unable, for any reason, to provide reasonable evidence (when requested by 
event staff) that their Robot and code are the result of their own work, it is appropriate 
to assume that the Team is in violation of <G2> and/or <G4>.
Event organizers cannot reasonably know the origins of every design or independent -
ly verify whether a Robot was created from scratch, purchased online, or copied from 
pictures of another Team’s design. When questions of authenticity arise, the only direct 
and fair approach is to require Students to explain and defend their work. This is not unlike 
academic honesty concerns in schools, and intellectual property concerns in business. 
By requiring Students to defend their designs, we ensure that they are developing not only 
technical skills, but effective communication skills and accountability, as well.
Consequences may include disqualification from Matches, removal from events, and/or 
escalation of the investigation to VEX Robotics and the RECF for further disciplinary action, 
which may include sanctions up to and including removal from the program.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Event staff should bear in mind <G3>, and use common sense when enforcing this rule. 
It is not the intent to actively hunt for Violations of this rule, compare every Robot at an 
event to all other known Robot designs, or closely question every team at an event about 
their Robot’s code. This rule is a set of tools for use if potential Violations are noted by or 
reported to event staff, and it is expected that most Teams will never be required to defend 
their Robot design or code.
 
Teams or individuals who deliberately weaponize, manipulate, or falsely report <G4> Vio-
lations for competitive gain or to harass another Team may be subject to a separate RECF 
Code of Conduct investigation. Misuse of this rule is considered a serious Violation.
 
Violation Notes: 
 ● Teams believed to be in Violation of this rule should be reported to the Judge Advisor, Head Referee, 
or Event Partner for further investigation in coordination with the RSM. Based on the investigation the 
Team may be removed from further Matches, have their Robot Skills Challenge scores removed, and/or 
be removed from consideration from judged awards.
 ● Violations of this rule will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in tandem with the RECF Student 
Centered Policy as noted in <G2>, and the REC Foundation Code of Conduct as noted in <G1>. All 
reported and/or suspected <G4> Violations should be reported to the Event Partners during the event, 
and should be reported to the RECF Rules and Conduct Committee following the event.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2677 - Teams may only use custom parts that were designed and created by the 
Students on that Team
 ● Q&A 2823 - Excerpts from the Student-Centered Policy about code, templates, and 
libraries
 ● Q&A 2834 - Specific G4 scenarios and clarifications 
 ● Q&A 2843 - Ownership of ideas when students legally change teams
 ● Q&A 2850 - Holecounting a design is not the same as being inspired by it
<G5> Each Student can only belong to one Team.  Each Team must include Drive Team Members, Coder(s), 
Designer(s), and Builder(s). Many also include notebooker(s). No Student may fulfill any of these roles for 
more than one VEX V5 Robotics Competition Team in a given competition season. Students may have more 
than one role on the Team, e.g., the Designer may also be the Builder, the Coder, and a Drive Team Member.
a. Team members may only move from one Team to another for non-strategic reasons outside of the 
Team’s control.
i. Examples of permissible moves may include, but are not limited to, changing schools, conflicts 
within a Team, or combining/splitting Teams.
ii. Examples of strategic moves in Violation of this rule may include, but are not limited to, one Coder 
“switching” Teams in order to program multiple Robots, one student designing multiple Teams’ 
Robots, or one Student writing the Engineering Notebook for multiple Teams.
36
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
iii. If a Student leaves a Team to join another Team, <G4> still applies to the Students remaining 
on the previous Team. For example, if a Coder leaves a Team, then that Team’s Robot must still 
represent the skill level of the Team without that Coder. One way to accomplish this would be to 
ensure that the Coder teaches or trains a “replacement” Coder in their absence.
iv. Points ii and iii are intended to represent real-world situations that are found in industry engi -
neering. If a vital member of a professional engineering team were to suddenly leave, the remain -
ing members of the team should still be capable of working on / maintaining their project.
b. When a Team qualifies for a Championship event (e.g., States, Nationals, Worlds, etc.) the Students 
on the Team attending the Championship event are expected to be the same Students on the Team 
that was awarded the spot. Students can be added as support to the Team, but may not be added as 
Drive Team Members or Coders for the Team.
i. An exception is allowed if only one (1) member of the Team is able to attend the event. The Team 
can make a single substitution of a Drive Team Member or Coder for the Championship event 
with another Student, even if that Student has competed on a different Team. This Student will 
now be a member of this new Team and may not substitute back to the original Team during the 
season. 
Note: Teams cannot “borrow” Students from other Teams to serve as Drive Team Members, 
Coders, Designers, Builders, or notebookers. However, Teams can add permanent members 
throughout the season under the guidelines of this rule.
Violation Note: Teams believed to be in Violation of this rule should be reported to the Judge 
Advisor, Head Referee, or Event Partner for further investigation in coordination with the RSM.
Event Partners should bear in mind <G3>, and use common sense when enforcing this 
rule. It is not the intent to punish a Team who may change Team members over the 
course of a season due to illness, changing schools, conflicts within a Team, etc.
Event Partners and referees are not expected to keep a roster of any Student who has 
ever been a Drive Team Member for one day. This rule is intended to block any instance 
of loaning or sharing Team members for the sole purpose of gaining a competitive 
advantage.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
General Game Rules
<GG1> Only Drive Team Members, and only in the Alliance Station.  During a Match, Robots may 
be only be operated by that Team’s Drive Team Members and/or by software running on the Robot’s 
control system in accordance with <R11> and <GG11>. A Team may send up to (3) Drive Team Members 
to their Alliance Station for each Robot, and those Drive Team Members must remain in their Alliance 
Station for the duration of the Match.
Drive Team Members are the only Team members that are allowed to be in the Alliance Station during a 
Match. Adults (other than event staff) are not permitted to be in the Alliance Station during a Match.
a. Drive Team Members are prohibited from any of the following actions during a Match:
i. Using any sort of communication device in the Alliance Station. Non-headphone devices with 
communication features turned off (e.g. a phone in airplane mode or a walkie talkie turned off) 
are allowed. If communication features are needed for translation apps during post- Match 
discussions, it should not be considered a Violation.
ii. Standing or sitting on any sort of object during a Match, regardless of whether the Field is on 
the floor or elevated, except as required by an official accommodation request  that has been 
approved by the REC Foundation.
iii. Bringing/using additional materials to simplify the game challenge during a Match.
iv. To ensure that Drive Team Members are aware of verbal calls during a Match (as an application 
of rules <T1>, <G1>, <S1>, and <G3>), powered headphones, earbuds, and/or passive earpieces 
connected to electronic devices cannot be worn/used in the Alliance Station except as required 
by an official accommodation request  that has been approved by the REC Foundation.
b. Individuals who are not Drive Team Members for a Match cannot provide directions, commands, or 
advice to the Drive Team Members during that Match. They’re welcome to provide cheerful, positive 
encouragement, but should not affect Match play or strategy.
Point iii is intended to refer to non- Robot-related items that directly influence gameplay, 
such as a speaker that plays a buzzer sound to distract your opponent. Provided no 
other rules are violated, and the items do not pose any safety or Field damage risks, the 
following examples are not considered Violations of <GG1>:  
 ● Materials used before or after a Match, such as a pre-Match alignment aid
 ● Strategic aids, such as a whiteboard or clipboard
 ● Earplugs, gloves, or other personal accessories
Violation Notes: Major Violations of this rule are not required to be Match Affecting, and could 
invoke Violations of other rules, such as <G1>, <G2>, or <G4>.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<GG2> A Team’s Robot should attend every Match. The Team’s Robot must report to the Field for 
the Team’s assigned Match, even if the Robot is not functional. If the Robot is not at the Field for the 
entire duration of the Match, the Team will be considered a “no-show” and receive zero (0) Win Points, 
Autonomous Win Points, Autonomous Points, and Strength of Schedule Points .
a. Teams are expected to participate in all scheduled Qualification Matches , Alliance Selection, and 
Elimination Matches (if they’re an Alliance Captain  or were selected to join an Alliance for Elimination 
Matches). Failure to attend scheduled Matches or Alliance Selection may be considered a Violation 
of <G1> and the Code of Conduct. Teams that participate in zero Qualification Matches  cannot be 
considered for judged awards.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2733 - A Robot has to be at least in the Alliance Station to avoid a no-show
 
<GG3> Robots on the Field must be ready to play.  When a Team puts their Robot on the Field, it must 
be prepared to play (e.g., batteries charged, sized within the starting size constraint, includes only the 
correct Alliance-color license plates, etc.).
a. Teams who use VEX pneumatics must have their systems charged before they place the Robot on 
the Field.
b. Robots must be placed on the Field promptly. Repeated failure to do so could result in a Violation of 
<G1>. The exact definition of the term “promptly” is at the discretion of the Head Referee and Event 
Partner, who will consider event schedule, previous Violations or delays, etc.
c. If a Robot is delaying the scheduled start of a Match, it may be removed from the Field at the 
discretion of the Head Referee and Event Partner. The Robot may remain at the Field so that the 
Team does not get assessed a “no-show” (per <GG2>).
d. If a Robot is not placed on the Field prior to the start of a Match, it cannot be placed on the Field 
during that Match.
e. If an event is using Smart Field Control and a Robot is unable to successfully connect to Smart Field 
Control prior to the scheduled start of a Match, the Head Referee may ask the Team to remove their 
Robot from the Field in accordance with clause C.
i. A Robot that connects to Smart Field Control but displays a ‘Legacy Field Control’ error on the 
field monitor is NOT considered successfully connected to Smart Field Control, and may be 
removed from the Field if it is delaying the scheduled start of a Match.
 
<GG4> Hands out of the Field.  Drive Team Members are prohibited from making intentional contact 
with any Blocks, Field Elements, or Robots during a Match, apart from the contact specified in <GG4a> 
or while introducing Match Loads as described in rule <SG9>.
a. During the Driver Controlled Period, Drive Team Members may only touch their own Robot if the 
Robot has not moved at all during the Match. Touching the Robot in this case is permitted only for 
the following reasons:
39
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
i. Turning the Robot on or off.
ii. Plugging in a battery.
iii. Plugging in a V5 Robot Radio.
iv. Touching the V5 Robot Brain screen, such as to start a program.
 
Note: Movement caused by an external force, such as another Robot, should not prevent a Drive 
Team Member from interacting with their Robot under this rule. 
b. Drive Team Members are not permitted to reach into the 3-dimensional volume of the Field Perimeter at 
any time during the Match, apart from the actions described above. Rule <S1> applies.
c. Transitive contact, such as contact with the Field Perimeter that causes the Field Perimeter to contact 
Field Elements or Blocks inside of the Field, could be considered a Violation of this rule.
d. Any concerns regarding Field Element or Block starting positions should be raised with the Head 
Referee prior to the Match. Team members may never adjust Blocks or Field Elements themselves.
If a Drive Team Member’s hands extend over the Field and/or Field Perimeter in a way that is 
safe and doesn’t contact anything in the Field, it’s unlikely to be a Violation. However, Head 
Referees may still ask Drive Team Members to step back and remain completely outside 
the Field when necessary (e.g., for safety reasons or to reduce the chances of gameplay 
interference).
 
 
<GG5> Match replays are allowed, but rare.  Match replays (i.e., playing a Match over again from its start) 
must be agreed upon by both the Event Partner and Head Referee, and will only be issued in the most 
extreme circumstances. Some example situations that may warrant a Match replay are as follows (note that 
this is not an exhaustive list):
a. Match Affecting “Field fault” issues.
i. Field Elements starting in incorrect positions, and out of the allowed tolerances (see <T5>).
ii. Tape lines lifting.
iii. Field Elements detaching or moving beyond normal tolerances (not as a result of Robot interactions).
iv. The Autonomous Period or Driver Controlled Period ending early.
v. Field control disconnecting or Disabling Robots. Note, this is sometimes confused with a Robot 
whose motors have overheated, or bent pins on a controller’s competition port causing intermittent 
drop-outs. In general, any true Field fault will impact both Alliances simultaneously, not one Robot at 
a time.
b. Match Affecting game rule issues.
i. Head Referee Disables a Robot for a misinterpretation of a rule Violation.
ii. Head Referee starts the Driver Controlled Period of the Match without determining the outcome of 
the Autonomous Period winner.
iii. The Field is reset before a score is determined.
iv. A Match is run before its scheduled time without a Team.

Note: As of the 2024-2025 season, the V5 white screen error is no longer a permitted 
cause for a guaranteed replay. More information about this error can be found here.
<GG6> Disqualifications.  When a Team receives a Disqualification  in a Qualification Match , they 
receive a score of zero (0) for the Match, as well as zero (0) Win Points, Autonomous Win Points, 
Autonomous Points, and Strength of Schedule Points .
a. If the Team receiving the Disqualification  is on the winning Alliance, then Teams on the opposing 
Alliance who are not also Disqualified will receive the win for the Match and two (2) Win Points.
i. The Team’s non-Disqualified Alliance Partner is unaffected, i.e., they will also receive the win for 
the Match and two (2) Win Points.
b. If the Match was a tie, then each Team on the opposing Alliance (the Alliance that did not receive 
the Disqualification ) will receive the win for the Match and two (2) Win Points. If both Alliances have a 
Team receiving a Disqualification , then all non-Disqualified Teams will receive a tie for the Match and 
one (1) Win Point.
c. Autonomous Win Points are not given to Teams that receive a Disqualification , and are not 
automatically awarded to the opposing Alliance. 
When a Team is Disqualified in an Elimination Match, the entire Alliance is Disqualified ; they receive 
a loss for the Match, and the opposing Alliance is awarded the win. If both Alliances receive a 
Disqualification  in an Elimination Match, both Alliances receive a loss and will play another Match to 
determine a winner.
 
Note: If a Team is Disqualified in a Robot Skills Match, a score of zero (0) will be recorded for that 
Match.
 
 
<GG7> Time Outs. Each Elimination Alliance gets one three-minute Time Out, which they may request 
during the Elimination Bracket . The Time Out will be served at the time of the Alliance’s next upcoming 
Match. Alliances must request their Time Out between Elimination Matches ; they may not use their Time 
Out during a Match, for another Alliance’s Match, or after they have been eliminated. There are no Time 
Outs during the Qualification Match  schedule.
a. A Time Out can be ended early, but only if agreed to by both Alliances and the Head Referee.
b. An Alliance’s Time Out request should never be denied if the Alliance legitimately needs extra time.
 
<GG8> Keep your Robots together. Robots may not intentionally detach parts during the Match or 
leave mechanisms on the Field.
Note: Parts which become detached unintentionally are a Minor Violation , are no longer consid-
ered “part of a Robot,” and should be ignored for the purpose of any rules which involve Robot 
contact or location (e.g., Scoring) or Robot size.
41
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Violation Notes: Major Violations of this rule should be rare, as Robots should never be designed to 
intentionally violate it. Minor Violations  are usually due to Robots being damaged during gameplay, 
such as a wheel falling off.
<GG9> Don’t hook your Robot to the Field, and don’t get Entangled.  Robots may not intentionally grasp, 
grapple, hook, attach to or otherwise Entangle with any Field Elements. Strategies with mechanisms that 
react against multiple sides of a Field Element in an effort to latch or hook onto said Field Element are 
prohibited. The intent of this rule is to prevent Teams from unintentionally damaging the Field and/or from 
anchoring to or otherwise Entangling themselves with the Field.
Whenever possible, Head Referees should alert Teams to potential Violations before they happen to 
prevent actual Violations. If a Robot takes immediate action to avoid or resolve the issue, and if the Head 
Referee determines that the issue had no effect on the Match, no Violation should be recorded.
Violation Notes:
 ● If a Robot is reaching inside the open top portion of a Goal, it is that Team’s responsibility to 
ensure that the Robot doesn’t become entangled with the Goal when approached by other 
Robots. <GG16> will not apply during related interactions, and a Robot that becomes entangled 
while reaching into the open top of a Goal will receive a <GG9> Violation no matter how they 
became entangled.
 
<GG10>  The red Alliance places last.  The red Alliance has the right to place its Robots on the Field last 
in Qualification Matches  and Elimination Matches . Once a Team has placed its Robot on the Field, in order 
to avoid schedule delays its position should not be adjusted prior to the Match. <GG3> applies. If a Team 
chooses to reposition their Robot after it has already been placed, the opposing Alliance will also be given 
the opportunity to reposition their Robots promptly.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG1>
 
 
<GG11> Controllers must stay connected to the Field.  Prior to the beginning of each Match, Drive Team 
Members must plug their V5 Controller into the Field’s control system. This cable must remain plugged in 
for the duration of the Match, and may not be removed until the “all-clear” has been given for Drive Team 
Members to retrieve their Robots. See <T8> for more information regarding Field control system options.  
Violation Notes: The intent of this rule is to ensure that Robots abide by commands sent by the 
tournament software. Temporarily removing the cable to assist with mid- Match troubleshooting, 
with an Event Partner or other event technical staff present and assisting, would not be considered a 
Violation. 
 
<GG12> Autonomous means “no humans.”  During the Autonomous Period, Drive Team Members are not 
permitted to interact with the Robots in any way, directly or indirectly. This could include, but is not limited 
to:
42
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 ● Activating any controls on their V5 Controllers
 ● Unplugging or otherwise manually interfering with the Field connection in any way
 ● Manually triggering sensors (including the Vision Sensor) in any way, even without touching them
Note: In extreme cases, with permission from the Head Referee, Teams may Disable their Robot 
during the Autonomous Period by holding the power button on their V5 Controller. This ex -
ception is only intended for egregious safety- or damage-related circumstances; Disabling an 
autonomous routine for strategic purposes would still be considered a Violation of <GG12>.
Violation Notes: See <GG13>. 
 
<GG13> All rules still apply in the Autonomous Period. Teams are responsible for the actions of their 
Robots at all times, including during the Autonomous Period. Any Violations, Major or Minor, committed 
during the Autonomous Period will result in the Autonomous Bonus being automatically awarded to the 
opposing Alliance and make the violating Team’s Alliance ineligible for the Autonomous Win Point.
If both Alliances commit Violations during the Autonomous Period, then no Autonomous Bonus will be 
awarded.
Violation Note: In general, Minor Violations  of SG rules that occur during the Autonomous Period 
should only affect the outcome of the Autonomous Period (i.e., the Alliance can’t win the Autono-
mous Bonus or earn an Autonomous Win Point ) and should not be considered when determining 
whether a Violation has been repeated during the event.
If a Head Referee determines that a Violation of an SG or GG rule during the Autonomous Period 
was intentional/strategic rather than accidental/situational, it should be recorded as a Minor or 
Major Violation and considered when determining whether a Violation has been repeated during 
the event. 
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2694 - Any major or minor violation during the Autonomous Period makes you 
ineligible for the AWP or Autonomous Bonus (no exceptions)
 
 
<GG14> Don’t destroy other Robots.  But, be prepared to encounter defense. Strategies aimed solely 
at the destruction, damage, tipping over, or Entanglement of opposing Robots are not part of the ethos 
of the VEX V5 Robotics Competition and are not allowed.
a. V5RC Push Back is intended to be an Offensive game. Teams that partake in solely Defensive or 
destructive strategies will not have the protections implied by this rule (see <GG15>). However, 
Defensive play which does not involve destructive or illegal strategies is still within the spirit of this 
rule.
b. V5RC Push Back is also intended to be an interactive game. Some incidental tipping, Entanglement, 
and damage may occur as a part of normal gameplay without Violation. It will be up to the Head 
Referee’s discretion whether the interaction was incidental or intentional.
43
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
c. A Team is responsible for the actions of its Robot at all times, including the Autonomous Period. This 
applies both to Teams that are driving recklessly or potentially causing damage, and to Teams that 
drive around with a small wheel base. A Team should design its Robot such that it is not easily tipped 
over or damaged by minor contact.  
Violation Notes:
 ● Major Violations of this rule are not required to be Match Affecting. Intentional and/or egre-
gious tipping, Entanglement, or damage may be considered a Major Violation at the Head 
Referee’s discretion.
 ● Repeated Violations within a Match or tournament could be considered a Violation of <G1> 
and/or <S1> at the Head Referee’s discretion.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2640 - Tipping caused by Blocks leaving Goals is not a Violation
 ● Q&A 2908 - Things to consider when deciding whether an interaction was intetional/
egregious
<GG15> Offensive Robots get the “benefit of the doubt” when judgment calls are required.  In a case 
where a Head Referee is forced to make a judgment call regarding a destructive interaction between a 
Defensive and Offensive Robot, or an interaction which results in a questionable Violation, referees will 
decide in favor of the Offensive Robot. This also applies during the Autonomous Period (see SG7a).
Head Referees must apply judgment when determining whether each Robot in a 
<GG15> interaction was Defensive or Offensive, and in some cases may need to 
consider which Robot was more Defensive or Offensive than another within the larger 
context of the Match. In these cases, the Head Referee should decide in favor of the 
less Defensive and/or more Offensive Robot based on the definitions and guidance in 
this game manual.
 
 
<GG16> You can’t force an opponent into a penalty.  Intentional strategies that cause an opponent to 
break a rule are not permitted, and will not result in a Violation for the opposing Alliance.
Violation Notes: In most cases, if a Team causes their opponent to break a rule, the Head Referee 
will simply not enforce the penalty on that opponent, and it will be considered a Minor Violation 
for the Team that forced a Violation. However, if the forced situation becomes Match Affecting 
in favor of the Team that forced the Violation, it will be considered a Major Violation for the Team 
that forced the Violation. 
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2776 - Example GG16 scenarios and suggested rulings
44

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<GG17> No Holding for more than a 3-count.  A Robot may not Hold an opposing Robot for more than a 
3-count during the Driver Controlled Period.
For the purposes of this rule, a “count” is defined as an interval of time that is approximately one second 
in duration, and “counted out” by Head Referees verbally. A Holding count should begin immediately 
once the Head Referee observes a suspected Holding interaction. 
 
The Holding count should pause when at least one of the following conditions is met: 
a. The two Robots are separated by at least two (2) feet (approximately one foam tile).
b. Either Robot has moved at least two (2) feet away (approximately one tile) from the location where 
the Trapping or Pinning count began. 
i. In the case of Lifting, this location is measured from where the Lifted Robot is released, not from 
where the Lifting began.
c. The Holding Robot becomes Trapped or Pinned by a different Robot.
i. In this case, the original count would end, and a new count would begin for the newly Trapped or 
Pinned Robot.
d. In the case of Trapping, if an avenue of escape becomes available due to changing circumstances in 
the Match. 
After a Holding count ends, a Robot may not resume Holding the same Robot again for a 5-count. If a 
Team resumes Holding the same Robot within that 5-count, the original Holding count will resume from 
where it ended. A Head Referee should use fingers to display the 5-count that occurs after the end of a 
Holding count, and “wave it off” after the Holding interaction has been cleared.
If the Head Referee determines that a Robot is not attempting to escape, then it is not 
considered Pinned or Trapped. This commonly occurs when the Robot has malfunc-
tioned and lost the ability to move, or when the Robot is defending a Field Element.
This criteria is not required for Lifting; the Holding status begins as soon as the 
opponent becomes Lifted. 
Holding is a standard and legal part of Head-to-Head game play, and only becomes a 
Violation if it exceeds the guidelines in this rule. By beginning a Holding count immedi-
ately after noticing a Holding interaction, and providing a visual signal when a Holding 
interaction has been cleared, Head Referees can help Teams avoid penalties.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2743 - The Park Zone is not an avenue of escape from Pinning, but generally is 
an avenue of escape from Trapping
 ● Q&A 2744 - “Under the Long Goal” is not an avenue of escape from Pinning, but 
generally is an avenue of escape from Trapping
45
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 ● Q&A 2744 - If two Robots are working together to Trap an opponent simultaneously, 
the Holding count can be applied to both Robots; it’s possible for them to legally 
take turns trapping, but it’s risky
 ● Q&A 2775 - More guidance on when and how to count Holding
 ● Q&A 2827 - Things to consider when deciding whether a Violation is Minor or Major
 
 
<GG18> Use Blocks to play the game.  Blocks may not be used to accomplish actions that would be 
otherwise illegal if they were attempted by Robot mechanisms. If a rule is Violated through the use of 
a Block instead of a Robot mechanism, it should be evaluated as though the rule in question had been 
Violated by a Robot mechanism. Examples include, but are not limited to:
 ● Interfering with an opponent’s Autonomous routine per <SG7>
 ● Using a Block to intentionally tip or Entangle an opponent Robot
The intent of this rule is to prohibit Teams from using Blocks as “gloves” to loophole any 
rule that states “a Robot may not [do some action].” This rule is not intended to be taken 
in its most extreme literal interpretation, where any interaction between an Block and a 
Robot needs to be scrutinized with the same intensity as if it were a Robot.
46
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Specific Game Rules
<SG1> Starting a Match.  Prior to the start of each Match, the Robot must be placed such that it meets 
all of the following criteria:
a. No larger than 18” (457.2 mm) long by 18” (457.2 mm) wide by 18” (457.2 mm) tall.
b. Not contacting any Blocks other than a maximum of one (1) Preload. See rule <SG5>.
c. Not contacting any Goals or Loaders.
d. Not contacting any other Robots.
e. Completely stationary (i.e., no motors or other mechanisms in motion).
f. Contacting the barrier that defines their Alliance’s Park Zone.
Note: Using external influences, such as Preloads or the Field Perimeter, to maintain a Robot’s 
starting size is only acceptable if the Robot would still satisfy the constraints of <R5> and pass 
inspection without these influences.
Violation Notes: The Match will not begin with any conditions in this rule unmet. If a Robot cannot 
meet these conditions in a timely manner, the Robot will be removed from the Field and rules 
<R3d> and <GG2> will apply until the situation is corrected. They will not receive a Disqualifica-
tion, but they will not be permitted to play in the Match.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG7>

47
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<SG2>  Horizontal expansion is limited.  Once the Match begins, Robots may expand horizontally beyond 
the 18” x 18” starting size limit within the following criteria:
a. The Robot can never be larger than 22” wide or 22” long (must always be able to fit within a 22”x22” 
square horizontal footprint).  
Violation Notes: 
 ● The primary intent of this rule is to limit Defensive horizontal expansion. As such, Robots that 
expand horizontally in the vicinity of multiple Goals may be subject to rule <GG15>, and will not 
receive the “benefit of the doubt” in the case of any Head Referee judgment calls.
 ● Incidental/insignificant infractions that occur during a Match are only considered Minor Viola-
tions. Repeated Minor Violations  should only escalate to a Major Violation in extreme circum-
stances. Examples of Minor Violations  include, but are not limited to:
 ○ Loose wires
 ○ Broken zip ties / rubber bands
 ○ Bent or broken mechanical components that are not used for strategic gain  
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG2>
 
<SG3> Vertical expansion is limited.  Once the Match begins, Robots may expand vertically beyond the 
18” starting size limit within the following criteria: 
a. No part of the Robot may exceed an overall height of 22” at any point during the Match (must always be 
able to fit within a hypothetical 22”x22”x22” cubic sizing box).  
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG2>
 
<SG4> Keep Blocks in the Field.  Teams may not remove Blocks from the Field. A Block that leaves the Field 
during Match play, intentionally or unintentionally, will be given to a Drive Team Member from the same color 
Alliance as the Block and may be used as a Match Load in accordance with <SG9>.
a. If a Block is leaving the Field (as determined by the Head Referee), but is deflected back into the field by 
a Drive Team Member, field monitor, ceiling/wall, or other external factor, it should still be considered 
“out of the Field” and removed by a scorekeeper or Head Referee. If the redirection occurred due to 
contact with a Drive Team Member, it will be at the Head Referee’s discretion whether or not <GG4> 
(hands out of the Field) should apply. 
Violation Notes: 
 ● After a Team’s third Match with any Violation of this rule (either Major or Minor), all subsequent 
Violations of this rule will immediately escalate to a Major Violation .
 ● Any Team that removes three (3) or more Blocks from the Field in a single Match will receive a 
Major Violation .
 ● If it is not clear which Robot was the last to contact the Block, all involved Teams with a color that 
is opposite to the Block will receive a Violation.
48
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 ● Due to the difficulty of determining Match Affecting implications of this rule, most Violations should 
be considered Minor. However, blatantly intentional and/or Match Affecting Violations (especially 
during Elimination Matches ) may still immediately escalate to a Major Violation at the Head Referee’s 
discretion. 
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2788 - Clarifications on how & when to return Blocks that have left the Field
 ● Q&A 2798 - Violation Note clarifications for the Autonomous Period
 ● Q&A 2809 - A Block on the Field Perimeter is still in the Field, unless it contacts something 
outside of the Field
 
 
<SG5> Each Robot gets one Block as a Preload.  Prior to the start of each Match, each Preload must be placed 
such that it meets all of the following criteria:
a. Contacting one Robot of the same Alliance color as the Preload.
b. Not contacting the same Robot as another Preload.
c. Not contacting or within the volume of a Goal or Loader.
Note: If a Robot is not present for their Match, then that Robot’s Preload may be used as a Match Load in 
accordance with <SG9>.
Violation Notes: See <SG1>.
 
<SG6> A Robot may carry, push, or plow an unlimited number of Blocks.  However, horizontal and vertical 
expansion limits apply to all parts of the Robot for the entire duration of the Match. See rules <SG2> and <SG3>. 
<SG7>  Don’t cross the Autonomous Line, and don’t interfere with your opponents’ actions.  During the 
Autonomous Period, Robots may not contact foam tiles, Blocks, or Field Elements which are on the opposing 
Alliance’s side of the Autonomous Line. 
a. The Autonomous Period should be primarily Offensive, with Teams focusing on scoring and executing 
strategic maneuvers rather than Defensive disruption. Teams should avoid actions that are primarily 
Defensive in nature, including but not limited to:
i. Intentionally disrupting Blocks or Field Elements on the opponent’s side of the Autonomous Line.
ii. Deliberately contacting an opponent’s Robot to interfere with their autonomous path.
b. While some incidental contact or unintentional interactions may occur with Robots and/or Blocks on the 
other side of the Autonomous Line, Teams that employ deliberate Defensive autonomous strategies that 
impact their opponents’ autonomous routines may be subject to Minor or Major Violations at the discretion 
of the Head Referee.
c. Teams may interact with the portions of each Goal that are on their Alliance’s side of the Autonomous Line, 
but may not reach across to interact with the “open” portion of a Goal on their opponents’ side of the Field.

Figure SG-7: These Blocks (circled in red) would be considered to be in contact with the Autonomous Line .
d. Blocks that begin the Match in contact with the Autonomous Line are not considered to be on either side, 
and may be utilized by either Alliance during the Autonomous Period. For the purpose of this rule, all eight 
Blocks that begin the Match in groups that cross the Autonomous Line are considered to be in contact 
with the Autonomous Line. See Figure SG-7.
e. Direct contact with either of the following during the Autonomous Period will result in the Autonomous 
Bonus and an Autonomous Win Point being awarded to the opposing Alliance, unless the opposing 
Alliance also breaks rules in the Autonomous Period:
i. An opponent Robot that isn’t interacting with either the Autonomous Line or objects that begin the 
Match positioned above or in contact with the Autonomous Line.
ii. Blocks on the other side of the Autonomous Line.
f. Causing a Block to contact an opponent Robot that is driving at the moment of contact is a Violation; 
intentional Violations may be subject to Major Violations and Disqualifications  at the discretion of the 
Head Referee.
i. Causing a Block to contact a stationary Robot is not considered a Violation unless the Head Referee 
determines it was a deliberate Defensive action.
ii. Blocks that move across the Autonomous Line through Goals are not subject to <SG7>.
Violation Notes:
• All Violations of this rule (Major or Minor) will result in the Autonomous Bonus being awarded to the 
opposing Alliance. See <SG8b> for a potential exception caused by Autonomous Line interactions 
and <SG7e> for specific examples that also award an automatic Autonomous Win Point .
• Intentional, strategic, or egregious Violations, such as intentional contact with an opposing Robot 
while contacting the foam tiles on the opposing side of the Autonomous Line, will be considered 
Major Violations and should result in a Disqualification  for the Match.
• Deliberate Defensive Autonomous strategies, as described in <SG8a>, may also be recorded as 
<G1> Violations at the Head Referee’s discretion. 
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG5>.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2645 - Descoring Blocks from Goals during the Autonomous Period is not a 
Violation, regardless of what happens to those Blocks afterward
 ● Q&A 2647 - Intentionally placing Blocks on the opponent’s side of the Autonomous 
Line is a Violation
 ● Q&A 2924 - Scenarios and penalties for Robots and/or Blocks that cross the Auton -
omous Line
 
 
<SG8>  Engage with the Autonomous Line at your own risk.  Any Robot who engages with Blocks that 
begin the Match on the Autonomous Line should be aware that opponent Robots may also choose to do 
the same. Per <GG12> and <GG13>, Teams are responsible for the actions of their Robots at all times. 
During the Autonomous Period, when Robots from opposing Alliances are both engaged with the same 
Block: 
a. If a possible <GG14> Violation occurs (e.g., damage, Entanglement, or tipping over), a judgment call 
will be made by the Head Referee within the context of <GG14> and <GG15> (just as it would if the 
interaction had occurred during the Driver Controlled Period ).
b. Incidental Violations of <SG7> will not be penalized and will not automatically award the 
Autonomous Bonus to the opponent as described in <GG13>. However, this allowance only applies 
when opposing Robots are interacting with the same element.
c. Intentional, strategic, repeated, or egregious offenses, such as negatively impacting Robots that 
are not engaging with the Autonomous Line, may still be deemed a Violation of <GG13>, <GG14>, 
<GG15>, <SG7>, <G1>, and / or <S1> at the Head Referee’s discretion. 
These gameplay elements are intended to be utilized by either Alliance during the Au-
tonomous Period. This will inevitably result in Robot-on-Robot interactions, both inci -
dental and intentional. The overarching intent of <SG8> is for the vast majority of these 
interactions to result in no rule Violations and/or penalties for either Alliance, just as no 
rules Violations occur in 99% of Driver-controlled interactions.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG6>.
 
 
<SG9>  Match Loads may be introduced during the Match under certain conditions.  For the purpose 
of this rule, “introduce” refers to the moment when a Drive Team Member has released a Block into a 
Loader. 
During this action, Drive Team Members’ hands may temporarily break the plane of the Field Perimeter. 
This momentary interaction is an exception to rule <GG4>. Excessive, unnecessary, or unsafe actions 
while introducing a Match Load may be considered a Violation of <S1> and/or <G1> at the Head 
Referee’s discretion.

Drive Team Members may introduce Match Load Blocks by placing them into either of the Loaders adjacent 
to their Alliance Station.
a. Blocks may only be added to Loaders during the Driver Controlled Period of a Match.
b. A Match Load Block may not be contacted by a Robot prior to being placed into a Loader.
c. Match Load Blocks may only be removed from a Loader by a Robot, and only through the bottom 
opening of the Loader.
d. Blocks that incidentally bounce out through the bottom opening of a Loader while being introduced 
should not be considered Violations.
e. A Block can only be added to a Loader if there are no Blocks partially or entirely within the orange 
portion of that Loader. 
Violation Notes:
a. For the purposes of Match Affecting calculations, each illegal Match Load should be considered 
worth a value of 3 points. These values are not added to the actual score. If subtracting 3 points 
per illegal Match Load from the the offending Alliance’s final score would change the outcome of 
the Match, then the <SG9> Violation should be considered Match Affecting.
b. For the purposes of this rule, the following guidelines should be used for escalating repeated 
Minor Violations  to a Major Violation during Qualification Matches :
1. Six or more illegal Match Loads in a single Qualification Match .
2. Three or more Qualification Matches  with at least one illegal Match Load (i.e., the third Match 
and all subsequent Matches with a Violation).
c. For the purposes of this rule, only Match Affecting Violations should be considered during Elimi-
nation Matches (i.e., repeated Minor Violations  in Elimination Matches  do not compound to Major 
Violations).
1. Point B-1 does not explicitly apply during Elimination Matches , although the risk of illegal 
Match Load becoming Match Affecting still inherently increases as the quantity of Match 
Loads increases.
2. Point B-2 does not apply during Elimination Matches .
The primary intent of clauses A & E are to prevent Match Load Blocks from being intro-
duced in a way that overfills the Loaders (e.g., Blocks extending well above the top of the 
Loader), thereby reducing potential <SG4> and <SG9> Violations resulting from Blocks 
being removed/ejected from the top of the Loader. If a Head Referee is not certain whether 
or not a Violation of clause E occurred, they should give the Team the benefit of the doubt 
and not record it as a Violation. This benefit of the doubt must be applied equally to all 
Teams and Matches at that event. We don’t intend this to be a rule that requires referees to 
closely watch every Loader. If there’s brief overlap in the orange portion of a Goal as Blocks 
are rapidly added to a Loader, it probably shouldn’t be considered a Violation.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUG3>.

Figure SG9-1: A Block is partially within the orange portion of 
the Loader, so it would not be legal to add a Block to this Loader.
Figure SG9-2: There are no Blocks within the orange portion 
of the Loader, so it is legal to add a Block to this Loader.
<SG10> Don’t reach inside enclosed sections of Goals, and no Goalkeeping. Robots are not permitted 
to directly contact Blocks that are fully within enclosed sections of Long Goals, but may add or remove 
Blocks from open sections of Goals at any time during a Match. 
 
A Robot can only reach into any open portion of a Goal to legally move Blocks (e.g., into or out of the 
Control Zone or the entire Goal). If a Head Referee sees a Robot that is Goalkeeping in the Driver 
Controlled Period of a Head-to-Head Match, that Robot should be verbally warned away and should 
receive an <SG10> Violation if it remains. 
a. Reaching inside the open top portion of a Goal to affect Blocks within that Goal is an inherently 
Defensive position, and will not get the benefit of the doubt ( <GG15>) if judgment calls are required.
b. If a Robot is reaching inside the open top portion of a Goal, it is that Team’s responsibility to ensure 
that the Robot doesn’t become Entangled with the Goal when approached by other Robots. <GG16> 
will not apply during related interactions, and a Robot that becomes Entangled while reaching into the 
open top of a Goal will receive a <GG9> Violation no matter how they became Entangled.
Violation Note: An <SG10> Violation should be considered Match Affecting if the Team responsible 
ties or wins the Match by 10 points or less.

<SG11> Park Zones are protected during the endgame.  During the last 20 seconds of a Match, 
Robots may not directly or indirectly contact the other Alliance’s Park Zone or opponent Robots that are 
partially or entirely within the vertical projection of that Park Zone.

Overview
Section 3 - The Robot
Inspection Rules
This section provides rules and requirements for the design and construction of your Robot. A VEX V5 
Robotics Competition Robot is a remotely operated and/or autonomous vehicle designed and built by a 
registered VEX V5 Robotics Competition Team to perform specific tasks.
There are specific rules and limitations that apply to the design and construction of your Robot. 
Please ensure that you are familiar with these Robot rules before beginning your Robot design. These 
“inspection rules” are verified prior to the beginning of each event, in a formal Robot Inspection.
See Figure V-1 for more information on how to handle Violations of inspection rules and CoC-related 
rules during Robot inspection.
Most of these rules are “hard limits,” such as the maximum number of motors permitted. However, 
some are “at inspector discretion,” such as determining a mechanism’s potential safety risk. At many 
events, the lead inspector and the Head Referee are the same person; if they are not, then the volunteer 
inspector should confirm any questionable judgment calls with the Head Referee. The Head Referee 
has final authority regarding all Robot rules, since it is ultimately their decision whether a Robot takes 
the Field for a Match after inspection has concluded (per <R3d> and <R3e>). See this REC Library article  
for more information and details on Robot inspection and legal parts.
<R1>  One Robot per Team. Each Team can only bring one (1) Robot to a given event in the VEX V5 
Robotics Competition. Though it is expected that Teams will make changes to their Robot at the 
competition, a Team is limited to only one (1) Robot at a given event, and a given Robot may only be used 
by one (1) Team. A VEX Robot, for the purposes of the VEX V5 Robotics Competition, has the following 
subsystems:
 ● Subsystem 1: Mobile robotic base including wheels, tracks, legs, or any other mechanism that 
allows the Robot to navigate the majority of the flat playing Field surface. For a stationary Robot, the 
robotic base without wheels would be considered Subsystem 1.
 ● Subsystem 2: Power and control system that includes a legal VEX battery, a legal VEX control 
system, and associated motors for the mobile robotic base.
 ● Subsystem 3: Subsystem 3: Additional mechanisms (and associated motors) that allow manipulation 
of Blocks and interactions with Field Elements and other Robots.
Given the above definitions, a minimum Robot for use in any VEX V5 Robotics Competition event 
(including Skills Challenges) must consist of subsystems 1 and 2 above. Thus, if you are swapping out 
an entire subsystem 1 or 2, you have now created a second Robot and have Violated this rule.
a. Teams may not compete with one Robot while a second is being modified or assembled at a 
competition.
b. Teams may not have an assembled second Robot on hand at a competition that is used to repair or 
swap parts with the first Robot.
56
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
c. Teams may not switch back and forth between multiple Robots during a competition. This includes 
using different Robots for Robot Skills Matches, Qualification Matches , and/or Elimination Matches .
d. Multiple Teams may not use the same Robot. Once a Robot has competed under a given Team number 
at an event, it is “their” Robot; no other Team may EVER compete with it.
The intent of <R1a>, <R1b>, and <R1c> is to ensure an unambiguous level playing Field for all 
Teams. Teams are welcome (and encouraged) to improve or modify their Robots between 
events, or to collaborate with other Teams to develop the best possible game solution.
However, a Team who brings and/or competes with two separate Robots at the same tour-
nament has diminished the efforts of a Team who spent extra design time making sure 
that their one Robot can accomplish all of the game’s tasks. A multi- Team organization that 
shares a single Robot has diminished the efforts of a multi- Team organization who puts 
in the time, effort, and resources to undergo separate individual design processes and 
develop their own Robots.
To help determine if a Robot is a “separate Robot” or not, use the subsystem definitions 
found in <R1>. Above that, use common sense as referenced in <G3>. If you can place 
two Robots on a table next to each other, and they look like two separate legal/complete 
Robots (i.e., each has the 3 subsystems defined by <R1>), then they are two Robots. Trying 
to decide if changing a screw, a wheel, or a microcontroller constitutes a separate Robot is 
missing the intent and spirit of this rule.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR1>.
<R2> Robots must represent the Team’s skill level.  The Robot must be designed, built, and programmed 
by members of the Team. Adults are expected to mentor and teach design, building, and programming skills 
to the Students on the Team, but Adults may not design, build, or program that Team’s Robot. See rules 
<G2>, <G4> and <G5>.
In V5RC, we expect Adults to teach fundamental Robot principles like linkages, drive-trains, 
and manipulators, then allow the Students to determine which designs to implement and 
build on their Robot. 
Similarly, Adults are encouraged to teach the Students how to code various functions 
involving applicable sensors and mechanisms, then have the Students program the Robot 
from what they have learned.
<R3> Robots must pass inspection.  Every Robot will be required to pass a full inspection before being 
cleared to compete. This inspection will ensure that all Robot rules and regulations are met. Initial 
inspections will take place during Team registration/practice time. Noncompliance with any Robot design 
or construction rule will result in removal from Matches or Disqualification  of the Robot at an event until the 
Robot is brought back into compliance, as described in the following subclauses.
57
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
a. Significant changes to a Robot, such as a partial or full swap of Subsystem 3, must be re-inspected 
before the Robot may compete again.
b. All possible functional Robot configurations must be inspected before being used in competition. 
This especially pertains to modular or swappable mechanisms (per <R1>) and Match starting 
configurations/sizes (per <R5>).
c. Teams may be requested to submit to spot inspections by Head Referees. Refusal to submit will 
result in Disqualification .
i. If a Robot is determined to be in Violation of a Robot rule before a Match begins, the Robot will 
be removed from the Field. The Robot may remain at the Field so that the Team does not get 
assessed a “no-show” (per <GG2>).
d. Robots which have not passed inspection (i.e., that may be in Violation of one or more Robot rules) 
will not be permitted to play in any Matches until they have done so. <GG2> will apply to any Matches 
that occur until the Robot has passed inspection.
e. If a Robot has passed inspection, but is later confirmed to be in Violation of a Robot rule during or 
immediately following a Match by a Head Referee, they will be Disqualified from that Match. This is 
the only Match that will be affected; any prior Matches that have already been completed will not be 
revisited. <R3d> will apply until the Violation is remedied and the Team is re-inspected.
f. All inspection rules are to be enforced within the discretion of the Head Referee within a given event. 
Robot legality at one event does not automatically imply legality at future events. Robots which rely 
on “edge-case” interpretations of subjective rules, such as whether a decoration is “non-functional” 
or not, should expect additional scrutiny during inspection.
g. Events may wish to use “inspection markers” (e.g., zip tie or sticker)  to identify Robots that have 
passed inspection at that event. Inspection markers are functional components and are subject to 
all Robot rules, including legal materials and robot size/expansion limits.
h. Event staff and volunteers are allowed to photograph Robots during inspection and/or at other 
times as needed.
<R4> There is a difference between accidentally and willfully violating a Robot rule.  Any Violation of 
Robot rules, accidental or intentional, will result in a Team being unable to play until they pass inspection 
(per <R3d>). 
However, Teams who intentionally and/or knowingly circumvent or violate rules to gain an advantage 
over their fellow competitors are in Violation of the spirit and ethos of the competition. Any Violation of 
this sort should be considered a Violation of <G1> and/or the REC Foundation Code of Conduct. A Team 
that circumvents a Robot rule for a competitive advantage should receive an immediate Disqualification  
for the current Match and be reported to the Event Partner for discussion with the REC Foundation 
Regional Support Manager. As a result of that discussion, the Team may be Disqualified from the event.  
 
The Violation should also be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee following 
the event.
58

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R5>  Robots must fit within an 18” x 18” x 18” volume. 
a. Compliance with this rule may be checked using the official VEX Robotics On-Field Robot Expansion 
Sizing Tool.
b. Event Partners may construct and/or provide any sizing tool that measures the correct dimensions.
c. Any restraints used to maintain starting size (i.e., zip ties, rubber bands, etc.) must remain attached 
to the Robot for the duration of the Match, per <GG8>.
d. For the purposes of this rule, it can be assumed that Robots will be inspected and begin each Match 
on a flat standard foam field tile.
The official sizing tool is intentionally manufactured with a slightly oversized tolerance. 
Therefore, any contact with the sizing tool (i.e., a “paper test”) while being measured 
should be considered a clear indication that a Robot is outside of the permitted size. 
This tolerance also provides a slight “leeway” for minor protrusions, such as screw 
heads or zip ties.
Other tools, such as custom sizing boxes or the legacy non-expanding VEX Sizing 
Tool (276-2086), may be used for informal checks. However, in the event of a conflict 
or “close call,” a check with the official On-Field Robot Expansion Sizing Tool takes 
precedence.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR1>.
 
<R6> Officially registered Team numbers must be displayed on Robot license plates.  To participate 
in an official VEX V5 Robotics Competition event, a Team must first register on RobotEvents.com and 
receive a V5RC Team number. This Team number must be displayed on the Robot using license plates. 
Teams may choose to use the official V5RC License Plate Kit, or may create their own using only legal 
materials.
a. License plates must be placed in fixed locations on exactly two (2) horizontally opposing sides of the 
Robot and must remain visible, legible, and attached for the entirety of the Match. The top of a Robot 
is not considered a “side” for these two license plates
i. License plates should be mounted in locations that remain stationary on the Robot during a 
Match (e.g, not on a rotating intake or flipping manipulator). The function of license plates is to 
identify Robots for referees, spectators, and other Teams. Identification is harder when a license 
plate on a Robot moves during a Match.
b. License plates must be attached to the Robot using materials that are legal for Robot construction. 
VEX IQ pins are no longer legal for mounting license plates on Robots.
c. Robots may only include license plates that match their Alliance color for the current Match (i.e., red 
Alliance Robots must have only red plates installed for the Match).
d. License plates are considered functional components, and must meet the requirements of all Robot 
rules.
e. Additional license plates cannot be used on the Robot for any purpose.
59
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
f. Team numbers must be in white font, and clearly legible.
g. Custom license plates used to meet the requirements of <R6a> and <R6f> must be within the 
following size limits:
i. Height: between 2.0 (50.8mm) and 2.5 inches (63.5mm)
ii. Width: between 4.0 (101.6mm) and 4.5 inches (114.3mm)
iii. Thickness: up to 0.25” (6.35mm) 
Imagine the Robot as a cube that’s sitting flat on a flat surface. License plates should be 
placed onto two (2) opposing faces of that cube (excluding the top and bottom).
The intent of this rule is to make it immediately apparent to Head Referees and other 
event personnel which Alliance and which Team each Robot belongs to, at all times. It 
will be at the full discretion of the Head Referee and inspector at a given event to deter-
mine whether a given custom license plate satisfies the criteria listed in <R6>.  
Teams wishing to utilize custom plates should be prepared for the possibility of this 
judgment, and ensure that they are prepared to replace any custom parts with official 
VEX license plates if requested. Not bringing official replacement plates to an event will 
not be an acceptable reason for overlooking a Violation of one or more points in <R6>. 
Teams are encouraged to use an easily-read, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial).
If a Robot must be removed from the Field based on this rule, <R3ci> applies and the 
Team should not be issued a “no-show.”

made from the V5RC License Plate Kit.

<R7> Let go of Blocks after the Match.  Robots must be designed to permit easy removal of Blocks from 
any mechanism without requiring the Robot to have power after a Match.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R8> Robots have one Brain. Robots must ONLY use one (1) VEX V5 Robot Brain (276-4810). Any other 
microcontrollers or processing devices are not allowed, even as non-functional decorations. 
This includes microcontrollers that are part of other VEX product lines, such as VEX Cortex, VEX EXP, 
VEXpro, VEX CTE, VEX RCR, VEX IQ, VEX GO, or VEX Robotics by HEXBUG. This also includes devices 
that are unrelated to VEX, such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.
a. V5 Robot Brain accessories (short flanges, long flanges, and the magnetic screen protector) are part 
of the V5 Robot Brain and are only legal for use on Robots as part of the V5 Robot Brain.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR10> and <VUR12>.
 
 
<R9> Keep the power button accessible.  The on/off button on the V5 Robot Brain and/or the Battery 
Cable connection on either the V5 Robot Brain or V5 Robot Battery must be accessible without moving 
or lifting the Robot. The V5 Brain screen must be easily visible during Robot inspection. Keeping the V5 
Brain screen visible throughout a Match is recommended but not required.  
This rule is in place to ensure the safety of both competitors and field staff . In the 
event that a Robot needs to be quickly powered off—whether due to a malfunction, 
Entanglement, or other safety concern—it is crucial that the power button and/or Robot 
Battery remains easily accessible. This allows competitors and/or field personnel to 
safely Disable the Robot without putting their hands near moving parts or other hazards 
inside the Robot.
Additionally, keeping screens and indicator lights visible helps officials diagnose issues 
efficiently, minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth competition experience. If the 
V5 Brain is accessible, Field volunteers can help Teams troubleshoot time-sensitive 
issues prior to a Match, including switching between Bluetooth and VEXnet radio modes 
as needed, selecting programs on the V5 Brain in instances that prevent selection via 
the V5 Controller, etc. Teams will also have easier access during any needed <GG4> 
clause a interactions.
<R10> Firmware. Teams must use VEXos version 1.1.5 or newer, found at https://link.vex.com/firmware . 
Custom firmware modifications are not permitted.
a. The minimum version requirement is subject to change over the course of the season.
b. When the minimum version is updated, Teams have a two week (14 calendar day) grace period from 
the time the minimum version is changed to update their firmware to the latest minimum version.
c. VEX reserves the right to deem any firmware update critical, and remove the allowable grace period.
61
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R11> Use a “Competition Template” for programming.  The Robot must be programmed to follow 
control directions provided by the VEXnet Field Controllers or Smart Field Control system.
During the Autonomous Period, Drive Team Members will not be allowed to use their V5 Controllers. As 
such, Teams are responsible for programming their Robot with custom software if they want to perform 
in the Autonomous Period. 
This may be tested in inspection, where Robots may be required to pass a functional “enable/disable” 
test. For more information on this, Teams should consult the help guides produced by the developers of 
their chosen programming software.  
<R12>  Motors are limited. Robots may use any combination of VEX V5 Smart Motors (11W) (276-4840) 
and Smart Motors (5.5W) (276-4842), within the following criteria:
a. The combined power of all motors (11W & 5.5W) must not exceed 88W. This limit applies to all 
motors on the Robot, even those which are not plugged in.
b. V5 Smart Motors and EXP Smart Motors connected to Smart Ports are the only motors that may be 
used with a V5 Robot Brain. The 3-wire ports may not be used to control motors of any kind.
Example A B C D E
Qty of 11W Motors 8 7 6 5 0
Qty of 5.5W Motors 0 2 4 6 16
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR11>.
 
 
<R13> Electrical power comes from VEX batteries only.  Robots may use one (1) V5 Robot Battery 
(276-4811) to power the V5 Robot Brain.
a. No other sources of electrical power are permitted, unless used as part of a non-functional 
decoration per <R24e>.
b. There are no legal power expanders for the V5 Robot Battery.
c. V5 Robot Batteries may only be charged by a V5 Robot Battery Charger (276-4812 or 276-4841).
d. V5 Controllers (276-4820) may only be powered by their internal rechargeable battery.
i. Teams are permitted to have an external power source (such as a rechargeable battery pack) 
plugged into their V5 Controller during a Match, provided that this power source is connected 
safely and does not violate any other rules, such as <R28>.
ii. Some events may choose to provide Field power for V5 Controllers. If this is provided for all 
Teams at the event, then this is a legal power source for the V5 Controllers.  
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR12>.
62
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R14> Robots use VEXnet.  Robots must ONLY utilize the VEXnet system for all wireless Robot 
communication.
a. Electronics from the Cortex, VEX EXP, VEX CTE. VEXpro, VEX RCR, VEXplorer, VEX IQ, VEX GO, or 
VEX Robotics by HEXBUG product line are prohibited unless otherwise noted in <R17>.
b. Teams are permitted to use the Bluetooth® capabilities of the V5 Robot Brain and/or V5 Controller 
in Team pits, practice Fields, and Robot Skills Matches. However, VEXnet must be used for wireless 
communication during head-to-head Matches.
c. Teams are permitted to use the Wi-Fi capabilities of the Vision Sensor in Team pits or outside of 
Matches. However, the Vision Sensor must have its wireless transmitting functionality disabled 
during Matches. 
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR2>, <VUR10> and <VUR12>
<R15> Give the radio some space.  The V5 Radio must be mounted such that no metal surrounds the 
radio symbol on the V5 Radio.
It is fine to loosely encapsulate the V5 Radio within Robot structure. The intent of this 
rule is to minimize radio connection issues by minimizing obstructions between VEXnet 
devices. Burying a radio deep within a Robot may result in Robot communication issues. 
It is also recommended that the LEDs on the radio be visible to aid in troubleshooting.
 
 
<R16> One or two Controllers per Robot.  No more than two (2) VEX V5 Controllers may control a 
single Robot.
a. No physical or electrical modification of these Controllers is allowed under any circumstances.
i. Attachments which assist the Drive Team Member in holding or manipulating buttons/joysticks 
on the V5 Controller are permitted, provided that they do not involve direct physical or electrical 
modification of the Controller itself.
b. No other methods of controlling the Robot (light, sound, etc.) are permissible.
i. Using sensor feedback to augment driver control (such as motor encoders or the Vision Sensor) 
is permitted.
<R17>  Robots are built from the VEX V5 system.  Robots may be built ONLY using official VEX 
V5 components, unless otherwise specifically noted within these rules. Product pages on the VEX 
Robotics website should be used as the official definitive source for determining if a product is a “V5 
component.”
a. Products from other VEX Robotics product lines that are specifically allowed by a clause of <R20> 
or “cross-listed” as part of the VEX V5 Product lines are legal for use in the VEX V5 Robotics 
Competition. For example, Flex Wheels and VersaHubs are VEXpro components that can be found 
on the VEX “Flex Wheels” page, and specific sizes are thus legal.

f. Commercially available items used solely for bundling or wrapping of 2-wire, 3-wire, 4-wire, or V5 Smart 
Cables, and/or pneumatic tubing are allowed. These items must solely be used for the purposes of 
cable/tubing protection, organization, or management. This includes but is not limited to electrical tape, 
cable carrier, cable track, etc. It is up to inspectors to determine whether a component is serving a 
function beyond protecting and managing cables and tubing.
g. Rubber bands that are identical in length and thickness to those included in the VEX V5 product line 
(#32, #64, #170, and #117B).

website. For more detail regarding legal pneumatic components, see the Legal VEX Pneumatics 
Summary document .
i. Zip ties with identical dimensions as those included in the VEX V5 product line, or their metric 
equivalents. Specific zip tie dimensions listed on the VEX Robotics website are nominal references to 
hardware sizes found within the VEX V5 product line and/or their metric equivalents. The designated 
size of the product may differ slightly from the actual measurement.
j. A Micro SD card installed in the V5 Robot Brain.
k. Aerosol-based cooling/freeze spray may be used to assist in cooling motors. Teams using freeze spray 
or similar products in ways that may reasonably be deemed unsafe could be subject to <S1> Violations.
l. Cleaners, disinfectants, and/or sanitizers may be used to assist in cleaning Robots, parts, components, 
etc. VEX Robotics recommends the following procedures for cleaning/disinfecting/sanitizing robot 
parts.
m. See rules <R21> through <R25> for additional legal non-VEX components.  
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2820 - Premade nets from prior game sets don’t count as string, and aren’t legal 
for use on Robots
 ● Q&A 2906 - Premade nets (e.g., basketball nets) aren’t legal; any net must be created 
with string by the team

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R21> Custom V5 Smart Cables are allowed.  Teams who create custom cables acknowledge that 
incorrect wiring may have undesired results.
a. Official V5 Smart Cable Stock must be used.
b. Use of non-VEX 4P4C connectors and 4P4C crimping tools is permissible.
c. V5 Smart Cables may only be used for connecting legal electronic devices to the V5 Robot Brain.
 
 
<R22> A limited amount of tape is allowed.  Robots may use a small amount of tape for the following 
purposes:
a. To secure any connection between the ends of two (2) VEX cables. 
b. To label wires and motors.
c. To prevent leaks on the threaded portions of pneumatic fittings. This is the only acceptable use of 
Teflon tape.
d. In any other application that would be considered a “non-functional decoration” per <R24>.
e. As an aglet at the end of rope/string to prevent fraying.
 
 
<R23>  Certain non-VEX fasteners are allowed.  Robots may use the following commercially available 
hardware:
a. #4, #6, #8, M3, M3.5, or M4 screws up to 2.5” (63.5 mm) long, and M2.5 x 8mm screws.
b. Shoulder screws with a shoulder length no longer than 0.20” and a diameter no larger than 0.176”.
c. Any commercially available nut, washer, standoff, and/or non-threaded spacer up to 2.5” (63.5mm) 
long which fits these screws.
The intent of the rule is to allow Teams to purchase their own commodity hardware 
without introducing additional functionality not found in standard VEX equipment. It is 
up to inspectors to determine whether the non-VEX hardware has introduced additional 
functionality or not.
For the purposes of this rule, weight savings is not considered additional functionality.
If a key component of a Robot’s design relies upon convincing an inspector that a spe -
cialized component is “technically a screw,” it is probably outside of the spirit and intent 
of this rule. 
All specific dimensions listed in this rule are intended to be ‘nominal’ references to 
hardware sizes found within the VEX V5 product line and/or their metric equivalents.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR9>

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<R24> Visual decorations are allowed.  Teams may add non-functional decorations, provided that 
they do not affect Robot performance in any significant way or affect the outcome of the Match. These 
decorations must be in the spirit of the competition. Inspectors and Head Referees will have final say in 
what is considered “non-functional.” Unless otherwise specified below, non-functional decorations are 
governed by all standard Robot rules.
To be considered “non-functional,” any guards, decals, or other decorations must be backed by legal 
materials that provide the same functionality. For example, if a Robot has a giant decal that prevents 
Blocks from falling out of the Robot, the decal must be backed by VEX material that would also prevent 
the Blocks from falling out. A simple way to check this is to determine if removing the decoration would 
impact the performance of the Robot in any way.
a. Anodizing and painting of parts is considered a legal nonfunctional decoration.  
Note: As of October 1, 2024, anodizing or color changing of parts (such as painting, etc., which 
changes the original appearance of parts) is no longer allowed in events in mainland China.  
b. Small cameras are permitted as non-functional decorations, provided that any transmitting 
functions or wireless communications are disabled. Unusually large cameras being used as ballast 
are not permitted.
c. VEX electronics may not be used as non-functional decorations.
d. Decorations that visually mimic Field Elements or Blocks, or that could otherwise interfere with an 
opponent’s Vision Sensor, are considered functional and are not permitted. The Inspector and Head 
Referee will make the final decision on whether a given decoration or mechanism violates this rule.
e. Internal power sources (e.g., for a small blinking light) are permitted, provided that no other rules are 
violated and this source only provides power to the non-functional decoration (i.e., does not directly 
or indirectly influence any functional portions of the Robot).
f. Decorations which provide feedback to the Robot (e.g., by influencing legal sensors) would be 
considered “functional,” and are not permitted.
g. Decorations which provide visual feedback to Drive Team Members (e.g., decorative lighting) 
are permitted, provided that they do not violate any other rules and serve no other function (e.g., 
structural support).  
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2652 - Soldering LEDs to other wires or components is not allowed
 
 
<R25>  A limited amount of custom plastic is allowed.  Robots may use custom-made pieces cut from 
certain types of non-shattering plastic, up to 0.070” thick.
a. Each Robot is limited to a maximum of 12 individual pieces cut from non-shattering plastic. This 
includes non-shattering plastic used in non-functional decorations.
b. Each individual piece of non-shattering plastic cannot be larger than 4” x 8” x 0.070”.
68
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
c. Teams must present and display ALL non-shattering plastic parts during inspection.
i. Inspectors will verify the total number of plastic pieces. They may use dry-erase markers or 
other forms or temporary marking to aid in counting.
ii. Inspectors will verify that no non-shattering piece exceeds the size limitation.
d. Plastic may be mechanically altered by cutting, drilling, bending, etc. It cannot be chemically treated, 
melted, or cast. Heating non-shattering plastic to aid in bending is acceptable.
e. Legal plastic types are polycarbonate (Lexan), acetal monopolymer (Delrin), acetal copolymer 
(Acetron GP), POM (acetal), ABS, PEEK, PET, HDPE, LDPE, Nylon (all grades), Polypropylene, PTFE, 
a n d FEP.
f. Shattering plastic, such as PMMA (also called Plexiglass, Acrylic, or Perspex), is prohibited.
g. Plastic sheets sold by VEX are considered “plastic” in the context of this rule, and are subject to the 
same limitations as “off-the-shelf” plastic sheets. Examples include the 276-8340 PET sheets, and 
the 217-6626 / 217-6627 polycarbonate sheets.
h. This rule does not apply to 3D printed plastic parts. 3D printed parts are not permitted in the VEX V5 
Robotics Competition for any purpose, including non-functional decorations.
 
Note: Teams are strongly encouraged to provide inspectors with 1:1 scale drawings, identical 
spares, or 1:1 scale tracings of their non-shattering plastic pieces to aid in inspection. Drawings 
and tracings should accurately reflect ALL shapes and dimensions of each piece.  
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rules <VUR3> & <VUR4>
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2648 - Teams must replace broken custom plastic that results in temporary, 
unintentional R25 Violations
 ● Q&A 2730 - Recommendations for bent plastic and robot inspection
 ● Q&A 2784 - Cutting a part diagonally across a 4”x8” sheet will require more 
evidence
 ● Q&A 2802 - A complex cut/bent part will require more evidence
 
 
<R26>  Pneumatics are limited.  A Robot’s pneumatic subsystem must satisfy all of the following 
criteria: 
a. Teams may use a maximum of two (2) legal VEX pneumatic air reservoirs on a Robot. The Air Tank 
200mL (included in the 276-8750 V5 Pneumatics Kit) and the legacy (pre-2023) reservoir are both 
considered legal reservoirs.
b. Pneumatic devices may be charged to a maximum of 100 psi.
c. The compressed air contained inside a pneumatic subsystem can only be used to actuate legal 
pneumatic devices (e.g., cylinders).
69
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Note: From a rules perspective, parts found in the V5 Pneumatics Kit (276-8750) and legacy (pre-
2023) pneumatic parts may be used interchangeably. A Legal Pneumatics summary can be found in 
the VEX Library , which includes additional pneumatics information.  
The intent of <R26a> and <R26b> is to limit Robots to the air pressure stored in two reser-
voir tanks, as well as the normal working air pressure contained in their pneumatic cylinders 
and tubing on the Robot. Teams may not use other elements for the purposes of storing or 
generating air pressure. 
Using cylinders or additional pneumatic tubing solely for additional storage is in Violation 
of the spirit of this rule. Similarly, using pneumatic cylinders and/or tubing without any air 
reservoirs is also in Violation of the spirit of this rule.  
The intent of <R26c> is to ensure that pneumatics are being used safely. Pressurized 
systems, such as a Robot’s pneumatic subsystem, have the potential to be dangerous 
if used incorrectly. This rule ensures the safety of participants, and prevents potentially 
unsafe uses in the future.
Another way of thinking of <R26c> is that “pneumatics should only be used with pneumat -
ics.” Teams should not use compressed air as a means of actuating non-pneumatic devices 
such as screws, nuts, etc. For example, pulling a pin with a pneumatic cylinder is okay, but 
using air to actuate the pin itself is not.
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUR14>
 
<R27>  Most modifications to non-electrical components are allowed.  Physical modifications, such as 
bending or cutting, of legal metal structure or plastic components are permitted.
a. Internal or external mechanical repairs of VEX Limit and Bumper switches are permitted.
i. Modifying the metal arm on the Limit Switch is permitted. 
ii. Using components from these devices in other applications is prohibited.
b. Metallurgical modifications that change fundamental material properties, such as heat treating or 
melting, are not permitted.
c. Pneumatic tubing may be cut to desired lengths.
d. Fusing/melting the end of legal nylon rope/string (see <R20e>) to prevent fraying is permitted.
e. Welding, soldering, brazing, gluing, or attaching parts to each other in any way that is not provided 
within the VEX platform is not permitted. Rule <R20d> is an exception to this rule.
f. Mechanical fasteners may be secured using Loctite or a similar thread-locking product. This may ONLY 
be used for securing hardware, such as screws and nuts.  
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rules <VUR3>, <VUR12> & <VUR13>

<R28> No modifications to electronic or pneumatic components are allowed.  Motors (including 
the V5 Smart Motor firmware), microcontrollers (including V5 Robot Brain firmware), cables, sensors, 
controllers, battery packs, reservoirs, solenoids, pneumatic cylinders, and any other electrical or 
pneumatics component of the VEX platform may NOT be altered from their original state in ANY way.
a. Teams may make the following modifications to the V5 Smart Motor (11W)’s user-serviceable 
features. This list is all-inclusive ; no other modifications are permitted. Where applicable, the 
components listed below (in the specific applications listed below) are permissible exceptions to 
<R20>.
i. Replacing the gear cartridge with other official cartridges.
ii. Removing or replacing the screws from the V5 Smart Motor Cap (276-6780).
iii. Removing or replacing the threaded mounting inserts (276-6781).
iv. Aesthetic/non-functional labeling (e.g., markers, stickers, paint, etc.).
b. V5 Smart Motors (11W) must use an official VEX V5 gear cartridge. For the purposes of this rule, the 
gear cartridges found within the V5 Smart Motor are considered “part of the motor.” Therefore, any 
physical or functional modifications to official gear cartridges is not permitted. V5 Smart Motors 
(11W) may only use official VEX motor cartridges
c. For the purposes of this rule, the V5 Smart Motor Cap is not considered “part of the motor.” 
Therefore, <R27> applies.
d. External wires on VEX 2-wire or 3-wire electrical components may be repaired by soldering or using 
twist/crimp connectors, electrical tape, or shrink tubing such that the original functionality and 
length are not modified in any way. 
i. Wire used in repairs must be identical to VEX wire. 
ii. Teams make these repairs at their own risk; incorrect wiring may have undesired results.
e. V5 Robot Brain accessories (short flanges, long flanges, and the magnetic screen protector) are 
considered “part of the V5 Robot Brain” and cannot be modified.

Section 4 - Robot Skills
Overview
In this challenge, Teams will compete in sixty-second (one minute) long Matches in an effort to score 
as many points as possible. These Matches consist of Driving Skills Matches , which are entirely 
driver controlled, and Autonomous Coding Skills Matches , which are autonomous with limited human 
interaction. Teams will be ranked based on their combined score in the two types of Matches.
The Robot Skills Challenge is an optional event for all Teams. Teams who do not compete will not be 
penalized in Qualification Matches  or Elimination Matches . However, participation in the Robot Skills 
Challenge may impact eligibility for judged awards at the event.
At events that include Qualification Matches , Teams may only participate in the Robot Skills Challenge if 
they also participate in the Qualification Matches . See rule <T20>.
Robot Skills Challenge Definitions
All definitions from previous sections of the manual apply to the Robot Skills Challenge, unless 
otherwise specified.
Driving Skills Match  - A Driving Skills Match  consists of a sixty-second (one minute) Driver Controlled 
Period. There is no Autonomous Period. Teams can elect to end their run early if they wish to record a 
Skills Stop Time.
 
Autonomous Coding Skills Match  - An Autonomous Coding Skills Match  consists of a sixty-second )
(one minute) Autonomous Period. There is no Driver Controlled Period. Teams can elect to end their run 
early if they wish to record a Skills Stop Time. 
Robot Skills Match  - A Driving Skills Match  or Autonomous Coding Skills Match .
Skills Stop Time  - The time remaining in a Robot Skills Match when a Team ends the Match early.
a. If a Team does not end the Match early, they receive a default Skills Stop Time of 0.
b. The moment when the Match ends early is defined as the moment when the Robot is “Disabled ” by 
the field control system. See the “Skills Stop Time” section for more details.
c. If a V5 Robot Brain or Tournament Manager display is being used for field control, then the Skills 
Stop Time is the time shown on the display when the Match is ended early (i.e., in 1-second 
increments).
d. If a VEXnet Competition Switch is being used for field control, in conjunction with a manual timer 
that counts down to 0 with greater accuracy than 1-second increments, then the time shown on the 
timer should be rounded up to the nearest second. For example, if the Robot is Disabled and the 
timer shows 25.2 seconds, then the Skills Stop Time should be recorded as 26.

<RSC1> Standard rules apply in most cases.  All rules from previous sections apply to Robot Skills 
Matches, unless otherwise specified in this section.
a. Removing Blocks from the Field in a Robot Skills Match is not a Violation. Blocks that leave the Field 
cannot be returned.
Violation Note:
 ●  In the Robot Skills Challenge, the standard definition of Match Affecting does not apply, because 
there is no winner or loser. When evaluating whether a rule Violation should be classified as a 
Major Violation or Minor Violation in the context of this criteria, the term “score affecting” can be 
substituted for “Match Affecting.” A Violation is considered “score affecting” if it results in a net 
increase of that Team’s score at the end of the Match.
 ● Violations of <GG>, <SG>, and <RSC> rules that occur during a Robot Skills Match should only 
affect the outcome of that Match and should not be considered when determining whether a 
Violation has been repeated during the event.  
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2794 - In Skills, there is no Violation if Blocks leave the Field through the top of 
Loaders
 
<RSC2> Scoring Robot Skills Matches.  For each Robot Skills Match, Teams are awarded a score based on 
the following rules and scoring table:
a. Teams will receive points for all Scored Blocks, regardless of color.
i. A Block is not considered Scored if it is in contact with a Robot at the end of the Match.
b. A Control Zone is considered filled if it ends the Match containing its maximum number of Scored 
Blocks, and if all Blocks in that Control Zone are the same color (e.g., all are blue, or all are red).
i. In a Robot Skills Match, a Center Goal Control Zone must contain at least seven (7) Blocks to be 
considered filled.
ii. A Long Goal must include one or more of the following to be considered filled in a Robot Skills Match:
1. Three Blocks of the same color fully contained between the inner edges of the Control Zone tape 
lines.
2. Four Blocks of the same color fully contained between the outer edges of the Control Zone tape 
lines.
c. The Team will earn points for a cleared Park Zone if no Blocks are in contact with the Floor inside the 
Park Zone at the end of the Match.
d. The Team will earn points for a cleared Loader if no Blocks are within that Loader at the end of the Match.
e. The Team will earn points for a Parked Robot if the Robot has moved during the Match, is within the red 
Alliance Park Zone, and meets all criteria of rule <SC4> at the end of the Match.
Robot Skills Challenge Rules

VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Each Block Scored in a Goal 1 Point
Each filled Control Zone in a Long Goal 5 Points
Each filled Control Zone in a Center Goal 10 Points
Each Cleared Park Zone 5 Points
Each Cleared Loader 5 Points
Parked Robot 15 Points
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2903 - Any movement in or of the Robot counts as having moved during the 
Match
 
 
<RSC3>  Robot and Field setup for Skills Matches. The Robot and Field are set up the same as for 
a Head-to-Head Match (e.g., the Robot must meet the requirements of <SG1>), with the following 
modifications: 
a. In Autonomous Coding Skills Matches , the VEX GPS code strip must be installed on the Field.
b. The Robot must start the Robot Skills Match in a legal starting position for the red Alliance.
c. All Drive Team Members must remain in the red Alliance Station for the duration of the Match.
d. One red Block must be used as a Preload in accordance with <SG5>.
e. Revised Block layout. 36 Blocks begin the Match in unscored positions on the Field and 24 Blocks 
begin in the Loaders, as shown in Figure RSC3-1.
f. Robots may move freely about the Field after the start of the Match.
g. Robot Skills Matches do not include Match Load Blocks. 
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rules <VURS1>, <VURS2> & <VURS3>.
<RSC4> Skills Stop Time.  If a Team wishes to end their Robot Skills Match early, they may elect to 
record a Skills Stop Time. This is used as a tiebreaker for Robot Skills Challenge rankings. A Skills Stop 
Time does not affect a Team’s score for a given Robot Skills Match.
a. Teams who intend to attempt a Skills Stop Time must “opt-in” by verbally confirming with the 
Scorekeeper Referee prior to the Robot Skills Match. If no notification is given prior to the start of 
the Match, then the Team forfeits their option to record a Skills Stop Time for that Match.
i. This conversation should include informing the Scorekeeper Referee which Drive Team Member 
will signal the stop. The Match may only be ended early by a Drive Team Member for that Match.
ii. If a Team runs multiple Robot Skills Matches in a row, they must reconfirm their Skills Stop Time 
choice with the Scorekeeper Referee prior to each Match.
iii. Any questions regarding a Skills Stop Time should be reviewed and settled immediately 
following the Match. <T1> and <T3> apply to Robot Skills Matches.
b. If the event is utilizing a V5 Robot Brain or the TM Mobile app for Robot Skills Challenge field control, 
a Drive Team Member may elect to start and stop their own Robot Skills Matches.

i. This V5 Robot Brain or other device running the TM Mobile app will be used to start the Robot 
Skills Matches (i.e., “enable” the Robot), end the Robot Skills Match (i.e., “Disable” the Robot), and 
display the official Skills Stop Time to be recorded.
ii. This V5 Robot Brain must be running the official field control user program.
iii. For more information regarding the use of a V5 Robot Brain for Robot Skills Challenge field 
control, and to download the official field control user program, visit this VEX Knowledge Base 
article.
iv. For more information regarding the use of TM Mobile for field control, see the Tournament 
Manager documentation .
c. At events which do not have a V5 Robot Brain or the TM Mobile App available for Robot Skills 
Challenge field control, Drive Team Members and field staff must agree prior to the Match on the 
signal that will be used to end the Match early.
i. As noted in the definition of Skills Stop Time, the moment when the Match ends early is defined 
as the moment when the Robot is “Disabled ” by the field control system.
ii. The agreed-upon signal must be both verbal and visual, such as Drive Team Members crossing 
their arms in an “X” or placing their V5 Controller(s) on the ground.
iii. The signal must be given by a Drive Team Member who is standing in the Alliance Station.
iv. It is recommended that Drive Team Members also provide verbal notice that they are 
approaching their Skills Stop Time, such as by counting out “3-2-1-stop.”
d. It is at the Event Partner’s discretion which method will be used to record Skills Stop Times at a given 
event. The chosen method must be communicated prior to the start of Matches (such as during an 
event meeting), and made equally available to all Teams.
i. If an event intends to use a manual timekeeping method, a Team may not bring their own V5 
Robot Brain just for use during their own Robot Skills Match.
ii. If an event intends to utilize a V5 Robot Brain, all Teams must use the same V5 Robot Brain for all 
Robot Skills Matches on a given Field.
iii. If an event is using multiple Fields for Robot Skills Matches, the same method must be used at all 
Fields, as described in rule <T21>. Multiple V5 Robot Brains may be used as needed (e.g., a “Field 
1 Brain” and a “Field 2 Brain”).
iv. The default “Drive” program accessed from a V5 Controller is intended for practice only, and may 
not be used for an official Robot Skills Match.
e. If a Team chooses to utilize/record a Skills Stop Time, the 5-second grace period described in rule 
<SC1> does not apply.

Overview
Section 5 - The Tournament
Tournament Definitions
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Head-to-Head Matches are played in a tournament format. Head-to-Head 
Tournaments consist of Qualification Matches  and Elimination Matches . Qualification Matches  are used 
to rank Teams based on Win Points (WP), Autonomous Points (AP), and Strength of Schedule Points  
(SP). The top-ranked Teams will then form Alliances to participate in Elimination Matches  to determine 
the tournament champions.
Teams also compete in optional Robot Skills Matches, in which Teams compete independently in sixty-
second Matches in an effort to score as many points as possible. 
For information about the requirements for tournaments that qualify Teams to championship events, 
visit this article in the REC Library .
Alliance Captain  - One of the Teams with the privilege of inviting another available Team to form an 
Alliance for the Elimination Matches . See <T16>. 
Alliance Selection  - The process of choosing the permanent Alliances for the Elimination Matches . 
Alliance Selection proceeds as follows:
1. The highest-ranked Team at the end of Qualification Matches  becomes the first Alliance Captain.
2. The Alliance Captain  invites another Team to join their Alliance.
3. The invited Team representative either accepts or declines as outlined in <T16>.
4. The next-highest-ranked Team becomes the next Alliance Captain.
5. Alliance Captains  continue to select their Alliances in this order until all Alliances are formed for the 
Elimination Matches .
Autonomous Points (AP)  - The second basis of ranking Teams. An Alliance who wins the Autonomous 
Bonus during a Qualification Match  earns ten (10) Autonomous Points. In the event of a tie, both 
Alliances will receive five (5) Autonomous Points.
 
Bye - A situation in which an Alliance automatically advances to the next round of tournament play 
without competing.
 
 
Elimination Bracket  - A schedule of Elimination Matches  for eight (8) to sixteen (16) Alliances. See 
<T17>.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Elimination Match  - A Match used in the process of determining the champion Alliance. Alliances of 
two (2) Teams face off according to the Elimination Bracket ; the winning Alliance moves on to the next 
round.
Event Partner - The volunteer VEX V5 Robotics Competition tournament coordinator  who serves as 
an overall manager for the volunteers, venue, event materials, and all other event considerations. Event 
Partners serve as the official liaison between the REC Foundation, the event volunteers, and event 
attendees.
Head Referee - A certified impartial volunteer  responsible for enforcing the rules in this manual as 
written. Head Referees are the only individuals who may discuss ruling interpretations or scoring 
questions with Teams at an event. Large events (e.g., Signature Events, World Championships, etc.) 
might include multiple Head Referees at the Event Partner’s discretion.
Match Schedule - A list of Matches that is generated at the start of an event. The Match Schedule 
includes the predetermined, randomly-paired Alliances that will be competing in each Qualification 
Match, and the expected start times for these Matches. The Match Schedule may be subject to change 
at the Event Partner’s discretion.
Figure MS-1: An example of a Qualification Match Schedule
Practice Match - A Match used to provide time for Teams and volunteers to get acquainted with the 
official playing Field and procedures. Practice Matches earn Teams zero (0) Win Points, Autonomous 
Points, and Strength of Schedule Points . Head Referees should not record or track standard gameplay 
violations that occur during Practice Matches. Violations that are egregious, unsportsmanlike and/or 
unsafe may be recorded and tracked at the discretion of the Head Referee.

Qualification Match  - A Match used to determine Team rankings for Alliance Selection. Each 
Qualification Match  consists of two Alliances competing to earn Win Points, Autonomous Points, and 
Strength of Schedule Points .
Scorekeeper Referee - An impartial volunteer responsible for tallying scores at the end of a Match. 
Scorekeeper Referees do not make ruling interpretations, and should redirect any Team questions 
regarding rules or scores to a Head Referee. 
Strength of Schedule Points (SP)  - The third basis of ranking Teams. Strength of Schedule Points  are 
equivalent to the score of the losing Alliance in a Qualification Match . In the event of a tie, both Alliances 
receive Strength of Schedule Points  equal to the tie score. If both Teams on an Alliance are Disqualified, 
the Teams on the not Disqualified Alliance will receive their own score as Strength of Schedule Points  
for that Match.
Win Points (WP)  - The first basis of ranking Teams. Teams will receive zero (0), one (1), two (2), or three 
(3) Win Points for each Qualification Match . Unless a Team is Disqualified, both Teams on an Alliance 
always earn the same number of Win Points.
 ● One (1) Win Point is awarded for completing the Autonomous Win Point task(s).
 ● Two (2) Win Points are awarded for winning a Qualification Match .
 ● One (1) Win Point is awarded for tying a Qualification Match .
 ● Zero (0) Win Points are awarded for losing a Qualification Match .
Win Percentage (WP)  - Replaces Win Points in a league event. Win Percentage is calculated by the 
number of wins divided by the number of Qualification Matches  the Team plays. In cases of a tie, the 
Team is given a 0.5 number of “wins” for that Match. The Autonomous Win Point is also considered 0.5 
“wins,” added to the total number of wins.

Tournament Rules
<T1> Head Referees have ultimate and final authority on all gameplay and Robot ruling decisions 
during the competition.
a. Scorekeeper Referees score the Match, and may serve as observers or advisers for Head Referees, 
but may not determine any Violations directly.
b. When issuing a Major Violation or Minor Violation to a Team, Head Referees must provide the rule 
number of the specific rule that has been Violated, and must record the Violation on the Match 
Anomaly Log.
c. CoC-related Violations  require additional escalation beyond the Head Referee’s initial ruling, including 
(but not limited to) investigation by RECF representatives.
d. Event Partners may not overrule a Head Referee’s gameplay or Robot decisions.
e. Every Qualification Match  and Elimination Match must be watched by a certified Head Referee. Head 
Referees may only watch one Match at a time; if multiple Matches are happening simultaneously on 
separate Fields, each Field must have its own Head Referee. Head Referees must follow the rules in 
this game manual and the Q&A, and must make rulings consistent with the intent of the game manual 
and Q&A.
f. At a minimum, every Robot Skills Match must be watched by a trained Scorekeeper Referee, who may 
only watch one Match at a time. If multiple Robot Skills Matches are happening simultaneously on 
separate Fields, each Field must have its own Scorekeeper Referee. A certified Head Referee must be 
available at the event to explain a rule, Disqualification , Violation, or other penalty to Teams in Robot 
Skills Matches as needed in support of the Scorekeeper Referees at skills Fields. 
Note from the VEX GDC: The rules contained in this Game Manual are written to be 
enforced by human Head Referees. Many rules have “black-and-white” criteria that can be 
easily checked. However, some rulings will rely on a judgment call from this human Head 
Referee. In these cases, Head Referees will make their calls based on what they and the 
Scorekeeper Referees saw, what guidance is provided by their official support materials 
(the Game Manual and the Q&A), and most crucially, the context of the Match in question. 
The VEX V5 Robotics Competition does not have video replay, our Fields do not have 
absolute sensors to count scores, and most events do not have the resources for an 
extensive review conference between each Match.
When an ambiguous rule results in a controversial call, there is a natural instinct to wonder 
what the “right” ruling “should have been,” or what the GDC “would have ruled.” This is 
ultimately an irrelevant question; our answer is that when a rule specifies “ Head Refer-
ee’s discretion” (or similar), then the “right” call is the one made by a Head Referee in the 
moment. The VEX GDC designs games, and writes rules, with this expectation (constraint) 
in mind.
83

 <T2> Head Referees must be qualified.  V5RC Head Referees must have all of the following qualifications:
a. Be at least 20 years of age.
b. Be approved by the Event Partner.
c. Be an REC Foundation Certified V5RC Head Referee for the current season. Visit the REC Library for more 
details.
d. Cannot be the Event Partner or a Judge Advisor for the event.  
Note: Scorekeeper Referees must be at least 15 years of age, and must be approved by the Event 
Partner.
Head Referees should demonstrate the following attributes:
 ● Thorough knowledge of the current game and rules of play
 ● Effective decision-making skills
 ● Attention to detail
 ● Ability to work effectively as a member of a team
 ● Ability to be confident and assertive when necessary
 ● Strong communication and diplomacy skills
<T3> Drive Team Members are permitted to immediately appeal a Head Referee’s ruling.  If Drive Team 
Members wish to dispute a score or ruling, they must stay in the Alliance Station until the Head Referee from 
the Match talks with them. The Head Referee may choose to meet with the Drive Team Members at another 
location and/or at a later time so that the Head Referee has time to reference materials or resources to help 
with the decision. Once the Head Referee announces that their decision has been made final, the issue is 
over and no more appeals may be made (See rule <T1>).
a. Referees are not permitted to review any photo or video Match recordings when determining a score or 
ruling.
b. Head Referees are the only individuals permitted to explain a rule, Disqualification , Violation, or other 
penalty to the Teams in a Head-to-Head Match. Teams should never consult other field personnel, 
including Scorekeeper Referees, regarding a ruling clarification.
Communication and conflict resolution skills are an important life skill for Students to practice and learn. In 
VEX V5 Robotics Competitions, we expect Students to practice proper conflict resolution using the proper 
chain of command. Violations of this rule may be considered a Violation of <G1> and/or the Code of Conduct.
Some events may choose to utilize a “question box” or other designated location for dis -
cussions with Head Referees. Offering a “question box” is within the discretion of the Event 
Partner and/or Head Referee, and may act as an alternate option for asking Drive Team 
Members to remain in the Alliance Station (although all other aspects of this rule apply).
However, by using this alternate location, Drive Team Members acknowledge that they are 
forfeiting the opportunity to use any contextual information involving the specific state of 
84
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
the Field at the end of the Match. For example, it is impossible to appeal whether a Block was 
Scored or not if the Field has already been reset. If this information is pertinent to the appeal, 
Drive Team Members should still remain in the Alliance Station, and relocate to the “question 
box” once the Head Referee has been made aware of the concern and/or any relevant 
context.
 
 
<T4> The Event Partner has ultimate authority regarding all non-gameplay decisions during an event. 
The Game Manual is intended to provide a set of rules for successfully playing V5RC Push Back; it is not 
intended to be an exhaustive compilation of guidelines for running a VEX V5 Robotics Competition event. 
Rules such as, but not limited to, the following examples are at the discretion of the Event Partner and should 
be treated with the same respect as the Game Manual.
 ● Venue access
 ● Pit spaces
 ● Health and safety
 ● Team registration and/or competition eligibility
 ● Team conduct away from competition Fields
This rule exists alongside <G1>, <S1>, and <G3>. Even though there isn’t a rule that says “do 
not steal from the concession stand,” it would still be within an Event Partner’s authority to 
remove a thief from the competition.
<T5> Be prepared for minor Field variance.  Field Element tolerances and Blocks may vary from specified 
locations/dimensions; Teams are encouraged to design their Robots accordingly. Please make sure to check 
Appendix A for more specific nominal dimensions and tolerances.
a. Field Element tolerances may vary from nominal by up to ±1.0”.
b. Block placement at the beginning of the Match may vary from nominal by up to ±1” (25.4mm). If a Block is 
within tolerance, either on the Field or within a Loader, it should not be adjusted before the Match.
c. Goal Heights may vary from nominal by up to ±1” (25.4mm).
d. Block weight may vary by up to ± 4g 
e. The rotation of Blocks is not specified. If a Block is within tolerance, either on the Field or within a Loader, 
it should not be adjusted before the Match.
f. Placement of Control Zone tape lines on the Long Goals may vary from nominal by up to ± 0.25”.
The Field Perimeter and Elements are designed to be assembled and disassembled multiple 
times each year. Event Partners store and transport Fields between events, and the individ -
uals setting up the Field at one event may differ from those at the next. While every effort 
will be made to ensure minimal variance, Teams should expect that any Field may be slightly 
different than another, and prepare accordingly. Just because something works on one Field 
does not fully guarantee it will work on the next, and is not enough evidence alone to deter -
mine if a Field is out of tolerance.

Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2787 - Examples of in-tolerance Blocks that should NOT be adjusted before the 
Match
 
 
<T6> Fields may be repaired at the Event Partner’s discretion.  All competition Fields at an event must 
be set up in accordance with the specifications in Appendix A and/or other applicable Sections. Minor 
aesthetic customizations or repairs are permitted, provided that they do not impact gameplay (see <T4>).
Examples of permissible modifications include, but are not limited to:
 ● Applying threadlocker to Field Element mounting hardware
 ● Using non-VEX white electrical tape to add required lines to the Field
 ● Using standard VEX Field tiles in place of the game-specific graphic tiles, for any reason
 ● Assembling Loaders without nut blocks to improve alignment of holes
 ● Anchoring Field Elements directly to Field risers instead of the metal plates
 ● Anchoring the metal plates to the underlying surface with hardware or tape
Examples of prohibited modifications include, but are not limited to:
 ● Unofficial Field Perimeter walls, additional structural elements inside of the Field Perimeter, or unofficial/
replica Field Elements
 ● Additional VEX structural parts attached to a Field Element
 ● Replacing the opaque Field walls on the VEX Portable Competition Field Perimeter with transparent 
panels
 ● Assembling a VEX Portable Competition Field Perimeter without including the securing straps
 ● Affixing stickers to the foam Field Tiles or otherwise marking object placements for Field reset
Any specific repairs and/or modifications which pertain to the current season’s game will be documented in 
this rule and Appendix A, as needed.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2740 - Adding additional tape markings to a Goal is a prohibited modification
<T7> Fields at an event must be consistent with each other.  There are many types of permissible 
aesthetic and/or logistical modifications that may be made to competition Fields at the Event Partner’s 
discretion. If an event has multiple Head-to-Head competition Fields, they must all incorporate the same 
permissible/applicable modifications. If an event has multiple Robot Skills Challenge Fields, they must all 
incorporate the same permissible/applicable modifications. For example, if one Head-to-Head competition 
Field is elevated, then all Head-to-Head competition Fields must be elevated to the same height. 
Examples of these modifications may include, but are not limited to:
 ● Elevating the playing Field off of the floor (common heights are 12” to 24” [30.5cm to 61cm])
86
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 ● Field control systems (see <T8>)
 ● Field display monitors
 ● Field Perimeter decorations (e.g., LED lights, sponsor decals on polycarbonate panels)
 ● Field Perimeter type (see <T9>)
 ● Utilizing the VEX GPS Field Code Strips  
Note: If an event has dedicated Fields for Skills Challenge Matches, there is no requirement for them 
to have the same consistent modifications as the Head-to-Head Fields. See <T21> for more details.
 
 
<T8> There are three types of Field control that may be used.
1. A VEXnet Field Controller controlled by Tournament Manager, which connects to a Controller’s 
competition port via ethernet cable.
2. A V5 Event Brain controlled by Tournament Manager, which connects to a Controller via Smart Cable.
3. A VEXnet Competition Switch, which connects to a Controller’s competition port via Cat-5 cable, 
may only be used in Practice Matches, Robot Skills Matches, and Leagues, and only under extreme 
circumstances.
If an event has multiple Fields, then all Fields of the same game type must use the same control system, in 
accordance with <T 7> and <T21>. For example, it would be permissible for Head-to-Head competition Fields 
to use V5 Event Brains, and for Skills Challenge Fields to use VEXnet Field Controllers. However, it would not 
be permissible for one Head-to-Head Field to use a V5 Event Brain while another Head-to-Head Field uses a 
VEXnet Field Controller. 
Note: Official Qualifying Events may only use the official, unmodified version of Tournament Manager 
for field control, along with approved hardware and networking solutions found in the REC Library.
Note 2: Add-ons that abide by the TM Public API guidelines are permitted. Once add-ons are enabled, 
the software is no longer supported by the REC Foundation, VEX Robotics, or DWAB Technologies; 
any necessary troubleshooting will be done at the user’s own risk.
<T9> There are two types of Field Perimeter that may be used.
1. VEX Metal Competition Field Perimeter (SKU 278-1501).
2. VEX Portable Competition Field Perimeter (SKU 276-8242).
See Appendix A for more details. 
If an event has multiple Fields, then all Fields of the same game type must use the same Field Perimeter type, 
in accordance with <T 7> and <T21>. For example, it would be permissible for Head-to-Head competition 
Fields to use metal Field Perimeters, and for Skills Challenge Fields to use Portable Field Perimeters. 
However, it would not be permissible for one Head-to-Head Field to use a metal Field Perimeter, while other 
Head-to-Head Fields use Portable Field Perimeters.
87
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<T10> Qualification Matches follow the Match schedule.  A Qualification Match Schedule will be available 
on the day of competition. The Match Schedule will indicate Alliance partners, Match pairings, and Alliance 
colors for each Match. For tournaments with multiple Fields, the schedule will indicate which Field each 
Match will take place on. The Match Schedule is subject to change at the Event Partner’s discretion. 
a. Practice Matches may be included in the Match Schedule at some events, but are not required. If Practice 
Matches are run, every effort will be made to equalize practice time for all Teams.
b. A Qualification Match  can only start before its scheduled time if all Teams, Robots, and assigned 
volunteers are at the Field and ready to play.
c. Any multi-division event must be approved by the REC Foundation RSM prior to the event, and divisions 
must be assigned in sequential order by Team number.
 
<T11> Each Team will have at least six Qualification Matches.
a. When in a tournament, the tournament must have a minimum of six (6) Qualification Matches  per Team. 
The suggested number of Qualification Matches  per Team for a standard tournament is eight (8) and up 
to ten (10) for a championship event.
b. When in a league, there must be at least three (3) league ranking sessions, with at least one (1) week 
between sessions. Each session must have a minimum of two (2) Qualification Matches  per Team. The 
suggested number of Qualification Matches  per Team for a standard league ranking session is four (4). 
Leagues will have a championship session where elimination rounds will be played. Event Partners may 
choose to have Qualification Matches  as part of their championship session.
 
<T12> Qualification Matches contribute to a Team’s ranking for Alliance Selection.
a. When in a tournament, every Team will be ranked based on the same number of Qualification Matches .
b. When in a league, every Team will be ranked based on the number of Matches played. Teams that 
participate at least 60% of the total Matches available will be ranked above Teams that participate in less 
than 60% of the total Matches available; e.g., if the league offers 3 ranking sessions with 4 Qualification 
Matches per Team, Teams that participate in 8 or more Matches will be ranked higher than Teams who 
participate in 7 or fewer Matches. Being a no-show to a Match that a Team is scheduled in still constitutes 
participation for these calculations.
c. In some cases, a Team will be asked to play an additional Qualification Match . The extra Match will 
be identified on the Match Schedule with an asterisk; Win Points, Autonomous Points, and Strength 
of Schedule Points for that Qualification Match  will not impact a Team’s ranking, and will not affect 
participation percentage for leagues. 
i. Teams are reminded that <G1> is always in effect and Teams are expected to behave as if the 
additional Qualification Match  counted.
ii. In leagues, Teams may have a different number of Qualification Matches . Rankings are determined by 
the Win Percentage, which is the number of wins divided by the number of Qualification Matches  that 
Teams have played.
88
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<T13> Qualification Match tiebreakers. Team rankings are determined throughout Qualification Matches  
as follows:
a. Average Win Points (Win Points / number of Matches played)
b. Average Autonomous Points (Autonomous Points / number of Matches played)
c. Average Strength of Schedule Points  (Strength of Schedule Points  / number of Matches played)
d. Highest Match score
e. Second-highest Match score
f. Random electronic draw
 
 
<T14> Small tournaments have fewer Alliances.  The number of Alliances for a given event is determined 
as follows, except in extraordinary circumstances with the permission of the location’s RECF Regional 
Support Manager:  
# of Teams # of Elimination Alliances
32+ 16
24-31 12
16-23 8
<16 # of Teams divided by 2, less any remainder
 
This rule is applied differently for VEX U. See Rule <VUT7>.
 
 
<T15> Send a Student representative to Alliance Selection.  Each Team must send one (1) Student 
representative to the playing Field (or other designated area) to participate in Alliance Selection. If the Team 
Representative fails to report in for Alliance Selection, their Team will be ineligible for participation in the 
Alliance Selection process.
Once the Alliance Selection begins, Student representatives cannot use electronic devices unless 
they have been demonstrated to be in airplane mode. No electronic communication by or with Student 
representatives is allowed during the Alliance Selection process.
Teams are advised to complete their scouting prior to the beginning of Alliance Selec-
tion, and to come to Alliance Selection prepared with a written list of potential Alliance 
Partners. Non-electronic methods of communication are allowed, and rule <G2> and the 
Student-Centered Policy still apply during Alliance Selection. Any communication about 
Alliance Selection and specific Teams should be limited to Student Team Members.
<T16> Each Team may only be invited once to join one Alliance.  If a Team representative declines an 
Alliance Captain’s invitation during Alliance Selection, that Team is no longer eligible to be selected by 
another Alliance Captain. However, they are still eligible to play Elimination Matches  as an Alliance Captain. 
89
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
This video includes a full explanation of the Alliance Selection process.
For example:
 ● Alliance Captain  1 invites Team ABC to join their Alliance.
 ● Team ABC declines the invitation.
 ● No other Alliance Captains  may invite Team ABC to join their Alliance.
 ● However, Team ABC may still form their own Alliance if Team ABC is ranked high enough after 
Qualification Matches  to become an Alliance Captain.
Note: Alliances must have two Teams, and there are no “do-overs” during Alliance Selection . If 
enough Teams decline their invitations such that the full number of Alliances cannot be filled, the 
event will proceed with a reduced number of Alliances. 
 
<T17> Elimination Matches follow the Elimination Bracket.  A sixteen (16) Alliance bracket plays as 
shown in Figure T17-1, with Matches proceeding in numbered order through each round.  
If an event is run with fewer than 16 Alliances, then they will use the bracket shown in Figure T17-1, with 
Byes awarded when there is no applicable Alliance. For example, in a tournament with 12 Alliances, 
Alliances 1, 2, 3, & 4 would automatically advance to the Quarterfinals.
 Figure T17-1: A 16-Alliance  bracket
Thus, an eight (8) Alliance bracket would run as shown below:

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
 Figure T17-2: An 8-Alliance  bracket
<T18> Elimination Matches are a blend of “Best of 1” and “Best of 3.”  “Best of 1” means that the 
winning Alliance in each Match advances to the next round of the Elimination Bracket . “Best of 3” means 
that the first Alliance to reach two wins will advance.
See the flowchart below for more information.

<T19> Ties in Elimination Matches lead to limited rematches.  In the case of tied Matches during 
Elimination Rounds, Tournament Manager will apply the following logic to determine which Alliance will 
progress to the next round.
a. In a “Best of 1” Elimination Round, the higher-seeded Alliance will advance and be declared the 
winner under the following guidelines.
i. After two (2) ties in a non-Finals Match.
ii. After three (3) ties in a Finals Match.
b. For single-division events or within a division: in a ”Best of 3” Elimination Round, the higher-seeded 
Alliance will advance and be declared the winner under the following guidelines.
i. After three (3) ties in a round in which neither Alliance has yet won a Match (0-0).
ii. After two (2) ties in a round in which each Alliance has won a single Match (1-1).
c. For single-division events or within a division: after two (2) ties in a “Best of 3” Elimination Round in 
which one Alliance has won a single Match (1-0), the Alliance with one (1) win will be declared the 
winner.
d. For a “Best of 3” overall Finals round at a multi-division event, Teams should continue to play 
tiebreaker Matches until one Alliance has won two (2) Matches.
 
<T20> Skills Match Schedule. Teams play Robot Skills Matches on a first-come, first-served basis. 
Each Team will get the opportunity to play exactly three (3) Driving Skills Matches  and three (3) 
Autonomous Coding Skills Matches .
Teams should review the event agenda and their Match Schedule to determine when the best possible 
time is to complete their Robot Skills Matches. If the Robot Skills Challenge area closes before a Team 
has completed all six (6) Robot Skills Matches, but it is determined that there was adequate time given, 
then the Team will automatically forfeit those unused Matches.
Details regarding logistics of Skills-Only Events can be found in the REC Foundation Qualifying Criteria  
document.
a. Robot Skills Matches are only available to Teams who participate in Qualification Matches , unless 
the event is an approved Skills-Only Event or in cases where a VURC or VAIRC Team records skills 
scores in accordance with this REC Library article . Teams who participate in Qualification Matches  
during a specific League Ranking Session are the only Teams who can participate in Robot Skills 
Matches at that session.
b. Skills scores recorded by ineligible Teams will be deleted from Tournament Manager before the 
event is finalized on RobotEvents.com.
 
 
<T21> There is no requirement that Skills Challenge Fields have the same consistent modifications 
as the Head-to-Head Fields.  For example, there is no requirement that all Skills Challenge Fields are 
elevated to the same height as Head-to-Head Fields. However, all Skills Challenge Fields at a single 
93
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
event must use the same type of Field control and Field Perimeter, as described in rules <T8> and <T9>.
It is strongly recommended/preferred that all Skills Challenge Fields are consistent with each other, but 
this may not be the case in extreme circumstances. 
In order to use non-conforming Head-to-Head Fields for Skills Challenge runs (e.g. during lunch), the 
following steps should be taken:
 ● Teams must be informed that the Head-to-Head Fields may have some differences from the Skills 
Challenge Fields (e.g., they might not have GPS strips).
 ● Teams must be given an opportunity to select which type of Field they want to use, i.e. they cannot 
be required to use a Head-to-Head Field for any Skills Challenge run.
 
<T22> Skills Rankings at events.  Teams will be ranked at an event based on the following scores and 
tiebreakers:
1. Sum of highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match  score and highest Driving Skills Match  score. 
2. Highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match  score.
3. Second-highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match  score.
4. Second-highest Driving Skills Match  score.
5. Highest sum of Skills Stop Times (see rule <RSC4>) from a Team’s highest Autonomous Coding 
Skills Match and highest Driving Skills Match  (i.e., the Matches in point 1).
6. Highest Skills Stop Time from a Team’s highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match  (i.e., the Match in 
point 2).
7. Third-highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match  score.
8. Third-highest Driving Skills Match  score.
9. If a tie cannot be broken after all above criteria, then the following ordered criteria will be used to 
determine which Team had the “best” Autonomous Coding Skills Match : 
a. Points earned for filled Control Zones.
b. Number of Blocks Scored in Goals.
c. Points earned for Parking
10. If the tie still isn’t broken, the same process in Step 9 will be applied to each Team’s best Driving 
Skills Match.
11. If the tie still isn’t broken, events may choose to allow Teams to have one more deciding Driving 
Skills Match, to be ranked according to the standard criteria above, or declare both Teams the Robot 
Skills Challenge Winner.

time, all else being equal.
8. Earliest posting of the Highest Driving Skills Match  score.
a. The first Team to post a score ranks ahead of other Teams that post the same score at a later 
time, all else being equal.
 
<T24> Robot Skills at League Events.  At league events in which Teams may submit Robot Skills 
Challenge scores across multiple sessions, the Robot Skills scores (combined highest Autonomous 
Coding Skills Match  and Driving Skills Match  scores) used for rankings will be calculated from Matches 
within the same session.
For example, consider the following scores for a hypothetical Team across two league event sessions: 
Autonomous Coding 
Skills Match Driving Skills Match Robot Skills Score
Session 1 40 60 100
Session 2 50 100 150
This Team would have a Robot Skills score of 150 for this event, and their scores from Session 2 would 
be used for the Event and Global tiebreakers listed in <T22> and <T23>.

Introduction
Section 6 - VEX U Robotics Competition
While many colleges and universities already use the VEX V5 system in their academic classes, many 
more have extensive manufacturing capabilities beyond the standard “VEX metal” library. Fabrication 
techniques like machining and 3D printing are more common than ever in collegiate engineering 
programs, and we can’t wait to see what VEX U Robotics Competition Teams from around the world are 
able to create under these more advanced rules. 
As in past years, the season will include a culminating VEX U event at the VEX Robotics World 
Championship, along with regional tournaments across the world. Participating schools will get the 
chance to prove their abilities in front of thousands of future engineers and show off what truly makes 
their school remarkable. The VEX U Robotics Competition is the perfect project-based supplement to 
many university level engineering programs, and gives Students the unique opportunity to demonstrate 
their real-world skills to potential employers (such as event sponsors).
Game, Robot, and Tournament Rules
The VEX U Robotics Competition uses the VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back Field with some 
minor modifications. Anyone that has a V5RC Push Back Field can use it for a VEX U event or Team. 
Please consult earlier sections of this game manual for the basic set of competition rules and details. 
All of the standard rules apply, except for the modifications listed in this document. In the event of a 
conflict between rules, the rules listed in this Section of the game manual and any rulings on the official 
VEX U Q&A take precedence.
VURC Definitions
Additional Electronics  - Any Sensor, processor, or other electronic component used in Robot 
construction, and connected to the V5 Robot Brain, that is not sold by VEX Robotics. Examples include 
commercially-available devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or custom devices designed and fabricated by the 
Team. See <VUR12> and <VUR13> for more details.
 
Alliance - A grouping of two (2) Robots from the same Team that have been chosen by the Students to 
play together during a given Match.
 
Electromechanical Assembly  - A complex system composed of multiple off-the-shelf components, 
which may include Sensors, mechanical parts, and actuators.
 
External Processor  - A computing device or microcontroller that independently processes Sensor 
data before sending it to the VEX V5 Brain.

Fabricated Part - Any component used in Robot construction that is fabricated by Team members. See 
<VUR3>, through <VUR7> for more details.
 
Neutral Zone - An area of the Field defined by and including white tape lines, which encompasses the 
Center Goals and their surrounding space. See VURS-1.
 
Raw Stock - Stock materials purchased from third-party vendors that may be used to create Fabricated 
Parts. See <VUR4> and <VUR5>.
 
Sensor - A device that detects and responds to changes in the environment, providing data to the 
Robot’s control system.
VEX U Student  - A Team member that meets all criteria listed in rule <VUT6>.
Rule Modifications: Field Setup
The VURC playing Field is set up differently than a Head-to-Head VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push 
Back Match, with the following modifications.
 ● The VEX GPS code strip must be installed on the Field
 ● Modified Field layout
 ● Modified tape lines

VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Rule Modifications: Game
<VUG1> Different Robot placement than rule <GG10>. The red Team has the right to place one Robot on 
the Field first, followed by both blue Robots, and ending with the 2nd red Robot. This applies in Qualification 
Matches and Elimination Matches . If this right is used, once a Team has placed a Robot on the Field, its 
position cannot be readjusted prior to the Match.
 
<VUG2> Different expansion.  The designated 24” Robot may expand horizontally and/or vertically up to a 
maximum size of 24” x 24” x 24” at any time during the Match.
 
<VUG3> Different availability of Loaders.  Drive Team Members may add Match Load Blocks to the 
Loaders adjacent to their Alliance Station during the Autonomous Period and Driver Controlled Period of the 
Match.
 
<VUG4> Different Autonomous Win Point criteria.  An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any VEX U 
Team that ends the Autonomous Period with all of the following tasks completed:
1. At least 12 Blocks of the Alliance’s color are Scored.
2. At least three (3) different Goals include at least one (1) Scored Block of the Alliance’s color.
3. The six (6) Blocks of the Alliance’s color that begin the Match in the Loaders adjacent to their Alliance 
Station have been removed.
4. At least one Robot is Parked in the Park Zone. 
<VUG5> Don’t cross the Autonomous Line, and don’t interfere with your opponents’ actions.  In VEX U 
Matches, <SG7> applies to foam tiles, Blocks, Field Elements, and interactions on the opposing Alliance’s 
side of the Autonomous Line and on the opponent’s side of the Field beyond the Neutral Zone. Interactions 
outside of the Neutral Zone should still be primarily Offensive, and must meet the guidelines and limitations 
in rule <SG7>.
a. Blocks that begin the Match in contact with the Autonomous Line or within the Neutral Zone are not 
considered to be on either side, and may be utilized by either Alliance during the Autonomous Period.
 
<VUG6> Engage with the Autonomous Line and Neutral Zone at your own risk.  This rule replaces the first 
paragraph of <SG8>. Any Robot that engages with Blocks or Goals that begin the Match or are located on 
the Autonomous Line or within the Neutral Zone should be aware that opponent Robots may also choose to 
do the same.
Robots entering the Neutral Zone should expect contact with other Robots, and should take this into 
consideration when designing and building. However, Rule <GG14> still applies within the Neutral Zone, and 
Teams can receive a Disablement or Major Violation for actions that a Head Referee deems intentionally 
damaging or egregious. 
100
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
The Neutral Zone and the Goals and Blocks within it are intended to be utilized by either 
Alliance during the Autonomous Period. This will inevitably result in Robot-on-Robot in-
teractions, both incidental and intentional. The overarching intent of <VUG6> is for the 
vast majority of these interactions to result in no rule Violations and/or penalties for either 
Alliance, just as no rules Violations occur in 99% of Driver Controlled interactions.
<VUG7> Some electronic devices may be in motion or moving at the beginning of the Match.  This 
includes active cooling fans, spinning LIDAR modules, and/or other similar sensors or Additional Elec-
tronics. These electronic devices should not initiate any form of motion for the entire Robot or any of its 
subsystems, and may not directly interact with game pieces and/or other Robots.
Rule Modifications: Tournament
<VUT1> Instead of a 2-Team Alliance format, VURC Head-to-Head Matches will be played 1-Team vs. 
1-Team. Each Team will use two (2) Robots in each Match.
a. Teams are allowed to build and bring as many Robots as they would like, but only two (2)—one of each 
size as described in <VUR1>—may be brought from the pit to the playing Field for any Match.
b. All Robots must pass inspection before they are allowed to compete.
 
<VUT2> Qualification Matches  will be conducted in the same manner as in a V5RC tournament, but in the 
revised 1v1 format described in <VUT1>.
Rule Modifications: Robot Skills Challenge
All rules apply from V5RC Section 4: Robot Skills Challenge, with no modifications other than those noted 
below.
<VURS1> VEX U Robot Skills Matches use the same Field layout, object placements, and tape lines as VEX 
U Head-to-Head Matches. 
a. If a VURC Team runs Robot Skills Matches at a V5RC event, they may choose from the following options:
i. Choose to run their Matches on a Field with the V5RC tape lines.
ii. Work with the Event Partner to replace the tape lines on a Skills Field to match the VURC tape layout. 
This option may not be available at all events, and the VURC Team should communicate with the 
Event Partner in advance to discuss options. The VURC Team might need to provide their own tape.
<VURS2> Both Robots must start the Robot Skills Match in legal starting positions for the red Alliance. All 
other portions of rule <SG1> apply.
 
<VURS3> Teams are permitted to use both Robots in their VEX U Robot Skills Challenge Matches, per 
<VUT1> and <VUR1>.
101
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<VUT3> Elimination Matches  will be conducted in the same manner as in a V5RC tournament, but 
without an Alliance Selection. At the end of the competition, one Team will emerge as the tournament 
champion. 
 
 
<VUT4> The Autonomous Period at the beginning of each Head-to-Head Match will be 30 seconds.
a. Human interaction with Robots during the Autonomous Period is strictly prohibited. 
b. If both Teams complete their routines before 30 seconds have elapsed, they have the option to 
signal that they wish to end the Autonomous Period early. Both Teams and the Head Referee must 
all agree on the “early stop.” This is not a requirement, and the option must have been established 
for all Teams at the event, such as during the event meeting.  
 
<VUT5> The Driver Controlled Period is shortened to 90 seconds and immediately follows the 
Autonomous Period.
 
<VUT6> VEX U Student eligibility.
a. All VEX U Team members MUST be matriculated in a post-secondary school OR have earned 
a post-secondary education diploma, certificate, or other equivalent during the six (6) months 
preceding the VEX Robotics World Championship. The intent of this rule is to permit VEX U Students 
graduating mid-year to still be able to finish their competition season.
b. Professionals not enrolled in post-secondary education are not eligible to participate on a VEX U 
Team.
c. Students who are dual-enrolled in both a secondary school and in post-secondary courses are not 
eligible to participate on a VEX U Team.
d. VEX U Students may only be on exactly one (1) VEX U Team for the season. See <G5>.
e. If at least one member of a VEX U Robotics Team is aged 18 or older, rule <S2> does not apply.
<VUT7> VURC tournaments have fewer Teams in Eliminations. The number of Teams in Eliminations 
for a given event is determined as follows, except in extraordinary circumstances with the permission 
of the RECF Regional Support Manager. A number of Teams below 16 will result in one or more Byes for 
highest-ranking Teams.

<VUR1> Teams may use two (2) Robots in each Match. 
a. Both Robots may only be built from the following materials:
i. Official VEX Robotics products (see <VUR2>) 
ii. Fabricated Parts made by the Team (see <VUR3> through <VUR7>)
iii. Commercially-available springs, fasteners, and bearings (see <VUR8>, <VUR9>, and <VUR15>)
iv. A legal electronics system (see <VUR10> and <V UR11>)
v. Any legal Additional Electronics  (see <VUR12>)
vi. A legal pneumatics system (see <VUR14>)
vii. Unmodified legal Raw Stock (see <VUR4> and <VUR5>)
b. One Robot must be no larger than 24” (609.6 mm) x 24” (609.6 mm) x 24” (609.6 mm) at the start of the 
Match.
c. One Robot must be no larger than 15” (381 mm) x 15” (381 mm) x 15” (381 mm) at the start of the Match. 
 
<VUR2> Teams may use any official VEX Robotics products , other than the exceptions listed in the tables 
below, to construct their Robot. This includes those from the VEXpro, VEX EXP, VEX IQ, VEX GO, VEX 123, 
VEX CTE, and VEX Robotics by HEXBUG* product lines. Rule <R28> applies, but most modifications to non-
electrical components are allowed.

As of November 2025, all VEXpro parts are discontinued. To maintain a level playing field 
and ensure all VURC Teams have access to the same library of parts, functionally equivalent, 
drop-in part substitutes for VEXpro parts may be considered to meet the intent of <VUR2>. 
In order to meet our intent, each functionally equivalent, drop-in part must:
a. Match the form, fit, and function of the VEXpro part it is replacing.
b. Not provide a discernable or perceivable  advantage over the comparable VEXpro part.
c. Comply with all other applicable VURC Robot rules.
Rule Modifications: Robot
103
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Teams should be prepared to demonstrate or defend their part substitutes in inspection as 
necessary, when possible. 
The GDC understands that this may be difficult in the immediate future, as the VEXpro 
website no longer hosts documentation on VEXpro parts, including but not limited to part 
descriptions, drawings, pictures, etc. The GDC is working with VEX Robotics to explore and 
identify a better long-term solution to this problem. In the interim, we ask all Teams, referees, 
inspectors, and the entire VURC community to:
1. Work collaboratively, understanding that the intent of this clarification is to allow Robots 
to compete with minimal to no modification, not to prevent participation. 
2. Apply <G1>, <G3>, and the RECF Code of Conduct when interpreting this guidance. We 
recognize this may temporarily result in a challenging inspection environment; good faith 
is essential.
3. Refrain from exploiting this allowance. We intentionally and meaningfully chose to attempt 
to maintain product legality and competitive fairness while products are discontinued. 
Deliberately pushing boundaries may force the GDC to entirely reassess the legality of all 
VEXpro components.
<VUR3> Fabricated Parts may be made by applying the following manufacturing processes to legal Raw 
Stock:
a. Additive manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing.
b. Subtractive manufacturing processes, such as cutting, drilling, routing, or machining.
c. Bending, such as sheet metal braking or thermoforming.
d. Attaching materials to one another, such as welding or chemically bonding (e.g., epoxy).
e. Molding of non-metals, such as injecting polyurethane into a 3D printed mold.
 
 
<VUR4> Fabricated Parts must be made from legal Raw Stock. To be considered Raw Stock, the material 
must be obtained in one of the following forms before undergoing the fabrication processes listed in <VUR3>:
Type Shape / Profile Examples
1 Sheet Flat Plane
• Sheet metal 
• ⅛” polycarbonate sheet
• Plywood
2 Solid Billet “Thick” rectangular 
beam / block
• 4” x 4” x 6” solid aluminum billet
• 2” x 2” x 2” acetal block
3 Solid Bar “Thin” rectangular beam • 2x4 wood planks
• ¼” x 3” aluminum bars
4 Hollow Bar Hollow rectangular beam • 1” x 1”, 1/32” wall aluminum box tube

• Steel ball bearing
• Shaped wood finial
Teams are not required to exhaustively define the specific material type for each com -
ponent of every Fabricated Part in their Engineering Notebook, as it should be obvious 
from the engineering drawings required by <VUR7>. However, unusual parts should be 
expected to receive increased scrutiny.
If any materials do not easily fall into one of these categories, then that is probably 
an indication that it is not intended to be a legal type of Raw Stock. If a Team cannot 
demonstrate that the component was made from a legal type of Raw Stock, then they 
will be asked to remove it from their Robot.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2654 -  Turned, ground, and/or polished round shafting is legal Raw Stock; final 
product is more important than manufacturing process when considering legality
 ● Q&A 2660 - Unmodified legal Raw Stock can be used on Robots without 
modification
 ● Q&A 2804 - Composite materials that fit these definitions are legal if they don’t 
violate VUR6
 ● Q&A 2805 - O-rings aren’t legal Raw Materials, and aren’t legal for use
 ● Q&A 2856 - Externally-threaded rod is legal raw stock
105
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<VUR5> The following material types are not considered Raw Stock , and are therefore not permitted:
Type Examples
1
Any otherwise-legal Raw Stock that 
has been post-processed by drilling, 
machining, or otherwise removing material
• Angle aluminum with regularly-
spaced holes or slots 
• Perforated sheet metal
2 Extrusions that do not fall under one 
of the categories listed in <VUR4>
• Non-rectangular aluminum extrusions, 
such as 80/20, T-slot, or Octanorm
• Gear stock
3
Assembled items (or pre-arranged 
kits of unassembled items) that form 
a single, more complex component
• Gearboxes
• Claw mechanisms 
• Swerve drive modules
4
Commercial Off-the-Shelf items 
that are intended to be used 
with minimal modification
• Wheels
• Gears
• Timing belts and pulleys
5 Materials that are intended 
to be cast or sintered
• Resin / powdered-bed 3D printing
• Molten aluminum used for sand casting
Note: <VUR2> takes precedence over this rule. Materials purchased from VEX Robotics that fall 
under one of these categories (e.g., VersaFrame pre-drilled extrusion) are permitted.
In industry, terms like “raw stock,” “raw material,” and “material stock” are often used 
interchangeably and cover an extremely broad scope of physical goods. The lists in 
<VUR4> and <VUR5> are intended to explain what specific material types and profiles 
fall under the defined term “ Raw Stock” in the context of the VEX U competition.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2857 - Non-VEX anti-slip mat is not legal for use on VURC Robots
 
 
<VUR6> Fabricated Parts cannot be made from Raw Stock which poses a safety or damage risk  to the 
event, other Teams, or Field Elements. Examples of prohibited materials include, but are not limited to:
a. Any material intended to produce flames or pyrotechnic effects.
b. Any material that is liquid at the time of the Match. Examples include hydraulic fluids, oils, greases, 
liquid mercury, and tire sealant.
i. This does not include fabrication processes that involve the use of liquids, such as milling 
coolant or epoxy.
c. Any matter that shatters or otherwise presents an excessive Field/safety hazard upon failure. 
Examples include fiberglass, acrylic, and carbon fiber sheet/tube stock.
i. This rule refers specifically to material legality itself. Any potentially unsafe mechanisms made 
from legal Raw Stock may still be addressed by <S1> and <R19>.
ii. 3D printer filaments that include carbon fiber (or similar) additives or carbon fiber (or similar) inlay 
are exempt from this exception, and are considered legal for use in Fabricated Parts.
106
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<VUR7> Fabricated Parts must be made by Team members. Any Fabricated Parts must be accompanied 
by documentation that demonstrates the Team’s design and construction process for that Fabricated Part. 
a. The minimum acceptable form of documentation is an engineering drawing with multiple views for the 
part in question. These drawings may be included in a Team’s Engineering Notebook or in a standalone 
appendix to the Engineering Notebook.
b. Any Fabricated Part must have been entirely designed and produced by Team members. For example, 
parts ordered by the Team and 3D printed by a third party would be prohibited.
c. Teams will be required to provide this documentation as requested by inspectors, Head Referees, or 
judges at any time at an event. Failure to provide acceptable documentation will result in the part being   
deemed illegal for use; therefore, <R3>, <R4>, and/or <G1> will apply.
<VUR8> Teams may use commercially-available springs  on their Robots. For the purposes of this rule, a 
“spring” is any device used for storing and releasing elastic potential energy. Examples include, but are not 
limited to:
a. Compression, tension, torsion, constant force, or conical springs made from spring steel.
b. Springs made from elastic thread or rubber, such as surgical tubing, bungee cords, or stretchable 
braided rope.
c. Closed-loop (pneumatic) gas shocks.
Note: Gas shocks are not considered pneumatic devices in the context of <VUR14>. Gas shocks may 
not be modified in any way. 
 
<VUR9> Teams may use commercially available fastener hardware  on their Robot. Examples include (but 
are not limited to):
 ● Screws, nuts, rivets, and heatset inserts.
 ● Hinges, pins, rod ends, threaded rods, and hose clamps.
 ● Ancillary fastener accessories, such as washers or spacers.
 ● Adhesives such as epoxy, glue, or tape (only when used to join together two parts).
If the primary function of the part is not “fastening”, then <VUR5>, <VUR6>, and/or <VUR7> take precedence 
over this rule. Illegal examples include (but are not limited to):
 ● A prefabricated non-VEX wheel, even though it may technically connect tread to a shaft
 ● 80/20 extrusion; other items get “fastened to it”, it is not the part doing the “fastening”
 ● Using grip tape to improve wheel traction  
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2649 - Primary function should be determined by the part’s use on the Robot
 ● Q&A 2703 - Brackets, shaft hubs, and shaft collars aren’t fasteners; the screws used to 
hold them on are fasteners

<VUR10> Each Robot must utilize exactly one (1) V5 Robot Brain and at least one (1) V5 Robot Radio 
connected to a V5 Controller. 
a. Teams must abide by the power rules noted in <R13> and <VUR12d>.
b. Wireless communication between Robots is permitted if using legal V5 Robot Brains and V5 Robot 
Radios. No other types of wireless communication protocols (e.g., radio, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) are 
permitted.
<VUR11> There is no restriction on the number of V5 Smart Motors (11W) [276-4840] and/or Smart 
Motors (5.5W) [276-4842]  that Robots may use. No other motors, servos, or electronic actuators are 
permitted, including those sold by VEX (e.g., the 2-Wire 393 Motor). 
Note 1: Rule <R28> still applies in VEX U. Teams may not modify Smart Motors, and must use 
official/unmodified gear cartridges.
Note 2: Commercially available pneumatic actuators and pneumatic solenoids are permitted within 
the guidelines of <VUR14>.
Note 3: Legal Additional Electronics  may include their own motor, servo, or actuator, per <VUR12>. 
 
<VUR12> There is no restriction on commercially available Sensors, External Processors , or 
Additional Electronics  that Robots may use for sensing and processing, except as follows:
a. Sensors and External Processors  MUST be connected to the V5 Robot Brain via any of the externally 
accessible ports (i.e., without any modification to the commercially available electronics). A Sensor may 
be connected to an External Processor which then connects to the V5 Robot Brain.
b. Sensors, External Processors, and Additional Electronics  CANNOT directly electrically interface with 
VEX motors and / or solenoid.
c. Sensors and Additional Electronics  may only receive power from any of the following: 
i. Directly from the V5 Robot Brain via any externally accessible port.
ii. From an additional lithium ion, lithium iron, or nickel metal hydride battery pack (only one (1) 
additional battery can be used for Sensor/processing power). This additional battery pack must 
operate at a maximum of 12 volts nominal.
iii. Directly from an External Processor
d. Only the V5 Battery can power the V5 Brain.
e. Sensors, External Processors, and/or Additional Electronics  which include a low-powered motor as an 
integral part of their primary sensing/processing function, such as an External Processor’s cooling fan 
or a spinning Sensor, are permissible.
i. Standalone motors which serve no additional sensing or processing functionality (e.g., using 
a commercially-available brushless motor in a drivetrain) are not considered legal Additional 
Electronics, and would be considered a Violation of <V UR11>.

f. Pneumatic solenoids are the only types of solenoids that are permitted as Additional Electronics . 
Solenoids used for any purpose other than opening and closing a pneumatic valve are considered 
an actuator and therefore prohibited, per <V UR11>.
g. <R28> still applies in VEX U, Teams may not alter or modify electronic parts from the VEX product 
lines.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2855 - Standalone cooling fans are not legal for use on Robots; fans that are 
built into legal components are
 
 
<VUR13> Commercially available Electromechanical Assemblies are not legal  for use on Robots.
a. For the purposes of this rule, any system that integrates Sensors with other mechanical parts 
that are fabricated by anyone other than Team members and which serve more use than the basic 
definition of a Sensor would be considered an Electromechanical Assembly, and is therefore not 
legal. 
b. Examples may include but are not limited to: odometry pods.
c. Commercially available Sensors with simple plastic housings that do not have any use beyond 
protecting internal components and aiding in mounting of the Sensor are not considered 
Electromechanical Assemblies . 
The intent of this rule is to remind teams to focus their efforts on integrating custom 
parts with the VEX Robotics ecosystem. The VEX U Competition operates within a 
semi-closed system, not an open-build system. Teams should make efforts to use VEX 
Robotics parts where possible. Parts like additional sensors (LIDAR, encoders, etc.) 
should generally be considered okay, but assemblies/systems from other robotics 
suppliers that remove the challenge of systems integration should not be considered a 
legal part.
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2637 - Teams can’t use off-the-shelf products that combine electronics and 
fabricated parts into a single packaged solution
 ● Q&A 2639 - Releasing air to move or block scoring elements or Robots is not allowed
<VUR14> Teams may utilize an unlimited amount of the following commercially available pneumatic 
components: cylinders, actuators, valves, gauges, storage tanks, regulators, manifolds, tubing, and 
solenoids. 
a. Pneumatic devices may only be charged to a maximum of 100 psi
b. Compressors or any other forms of “on- Robot” charging are not permitted
c. All commercial components must be rated for 100 psi or higher. Teams should be prepared to 
provide documentation that verifies these ratings to inspectors if requested

Team Composition
We want to see Universities face off in a global head-to-head competition. Schools are not limited to 
one Team, and a Team may consist of multiple colleges, but we hope that each Team identifies with 
and proudly represents one (1) post-secondary institution. (e.g., “Clarkson University” vs. “UC Santa 
Barbara”). Of course, college-level “club” Teams and mixed composition Teams are encouraged to join! 
However, as noted in <VUT7>, Students who have not yet graduated secondary school are not eligible 
to participate in VEX U, even if they are “dual-enrolled” or taking post-secondary courses. A Student 
cannot be a member of a V5RC and a VURC Team simultaneously, regardless of eligibility.
d. Components must not be modified from their original state, other than the following exceptions:
i. Cutting pneumatic tubing or wiring to length; assembling components using pre-existing 
threads, brackets, or fittings; or minor cosmetic labels
e. If commercially available 12V solenoids are used, these are considered Additional Electronics  and 
must therefore satisfy all conditions listed in <VUR12>. 12V solenoids may be either powered by an 
additional power source (per <VUR12d>), or by a 5V-12V step-up converter from the V5 Robot Brain. 
If an external power source (or other Additional Electronics  device) is used to interface with the 
solenoid, Teams MUST be able to demonstrate that there is no way for the solenoid to receive power 
while the Robot is receiving a Disabled state from the field controller
<VUR15> Teams may use commercially available bearings on their Robot.  For the purpose of this 
rule, a ‘bearing’ is a part that supports external loads, reduces friction, and improves efficiency by 
facilitating smooth dynamic motion between components. Legal examples include (but are not limited 
to):
 ● Parts supporting rotational motion: radial bearings, roller bearings, thrust bearings, needle bearings, 
one-way bearings, bushings, etc.
 ● Parts supporting linear motion: linear bearings, linear slides, drawer slides, etc.  
Significant Q&As:
 ● Q&A 2777 - Commercial linear guides with integrated rails are legal when used as 
linear bearings/slides

Section 7 - VEX AI Robotics Competition
Game, Robot, and Tournament Rules
Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a staple in today’s industry. The VEX AI Robotics Competition (VAIRC) 
gives Teams of Students a chance to compete in this growing field. With just a few additional sensors, Teams 
will be playing in one-vs-one Matches using two Robots per Team (i.e., four Robots on the Field) that are fully 
autonomous. Robots function without input from Drive Team Members and instead are communicating with 
each other as the Match progresses through two minutes. VAIRC is the perfect project-based supplement to 
many high school and university-level engineering programs, and gives Students the unique opportunity to 
demonstrate their real-world AI skills to potential employers (such as REC Foundation sponsors).
The 2025-2026 season should provide expanded opportunities for VAIRC competitors, such as VAIRC 
divisions at select VURC events and ways for Teams to submit Robot Skills Challenge scores at local V5RC 
events.
The VEX AI Robotics Competition uses the VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back Field with some minor 
modifications. Anyone that has a V5RC Push Back Field can use it for a VEX AI event or Team. Please consult 
earlier sections of this game manual for the basic set of competition rules and details. Many VAIRC rules that 
don’t match the standard V5RC rules are based on the VURC rules, which can be found in Section 6. As such, 
all standard VURC Game, Robot, & Tournament rules apply, except for the modifications listed in this section. 
In the event of a rules conflict, the rules listed in this section and rulings on the VAIRC Q&A system takes 
precedence.
All of the standard rules apply, except for the modifications listed in this document. In the event of a conflict 
between rules, the rules listed in this Section of the game manual and any rulings on the official VEX U Q&A 
take precedence.
Note: The VAIRC rules may be modified in upcoming major game manual releases in ways that affect Robots 
and Match play, including but not limited to revised Field layouts, revised robot rules, and the addition of 
visual markers to aid AI in detecting Field Elements. This version of the rules is intended to give VAIRC 
Teams an idea of our intentions for this game, and a starting point to begin planning Robot design and Match 
strategy.
VAIRC Definitions
Bullseye - The square at the center of the printed Block images on the Push Back graphic field tiles. (See 
Figure BE-1.) Only used in VAIRC Robot Skills Matches.

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
Interaction Period – The one-minute 45-second (1:45) time period that follows the Isolation Period 
after the winner of the Isolation Period has been determined. Robots react only to sensor inputs and to 
commands pre-programmed by the Students into the Robot control system and can interact with the 
entire Field during the Interaction Period. The Interaction Period replaces the Driver Controlled Period 
that occurs in V5RC and VURC Matches.
  
Isolation Bonus  – A point bonus awarded to the Team that has earned the most points at the end of the 
Isolation Period. The Isolation Bonus replaces the Autonomous Bonus. See rule <VAISC3>.
 
          
Isolation Period – A 15-second (0:15) time period during which Robots operate only on their side of the 
Field and react only to sensor inputs and to commands pre-programmed by the Students into the Robot 
control system. This Isolation Period replaces the Autonomous Period normally found in a VURC Match.
 
Isolation Win Point  – One (1) Win Point (WP) given to an Alliance that has completed the Isolation Win 
Point criteria set forth in rule <VAISC4>. The Isolation Win Point replaces the Autonomous Win Point.
Figure CB-1: A diagram of the VAIRC Field, showing the four pairs of goal-ends needed to receive a Control Bonus.
Control Bonus – One of four bonuses that can be earned by having a Block of your Team’s color Scored 
as the outermost Block in one end of a Long Goal and the nearest corresponding end of a Center Goal 
(see figure CB-1).

Rule Modifications: Field Setup
The VAIRC playing Field is set up differently than a Head-to-Head VEX V5 or VEX U Robotics 
Competition Push Back Match, with the following modifications.
 ● The VEX GPS code strip must be installed on the Field
 ● Opaque field panels (standard on the V5RC Portable Field Perimeter)
 ● Modified Field layout
 ● Same tape lines as V5 Robotics Competition Push Back

Rule Modifications: Scoring
Isolation Bonus 10 Points
Each Block Scored 3 Points
Each Control Bonus 10 Points
Parked 24” Robot 10 Points
 
<VAISC1> A Team receives a Control Bonus if the outermost Block Scored in one end of a Long Goal 
and the nearest corresponding end of a Center Goal are the same color as the Team.
a. A Block must be considered Scored in a Goal (see <SC2>) to count toward a Control Bonus.
b. A Block that is entirely within the space defined by the outer edges of the two white tape lines of a 
Long Goal does not count toward the Control Bonus (see figure VAISC1-1).
c. In a Center Goal, the Scored Block that is closest to that end of the Goal will count toward the 
Control Bonus (see figure VAISC1-2). If only one Block is Scored in a Center Goal, it will count toward 
both of the Control Bonuses which include that Goal.
Figure VAISC1-1: Portion of the Long Goal that 
can count toward that Control Bonus .
Figure VAISC1-2: The red Block would 
count toward the Control Bonus .
<VAISC2> A VAIRC Robot is considered Parked at the end of the Match if it meets all of the following 
criteria:
a. The Robot is designated as the Team’s 24” Robot for the current Match.
b. The Robot meets all criteria of rule <SC4>.
115
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<VAISC3> Scoring of the Isolation Bonus  is evaluated immediately after the Isolation Period ends (i.e., 
once all Blocks, Field Elements, and Robots on the Field come to rest). 
a. Points for Parked Robots are not included in the calculation of a Team’s score for the purposes of 
determining the Isolation Bonus.
b. If the Interaction Period ends in a tie, including a zero-to-zero tie, each Team will receive an Isolation 
Bonus of five (5) points.
c. Any Violations, Major or Minor, committed during the Isolation Period will result in the Isolation 
Bonus being automatically awarded to the opposing Team. See <GG13>.
d. Per rule <GG13>, if both Teams commit Violations during the Interaction Period that would have 
affected the outcome of the Isolation Bonus, then no Isolation Bonus will be awarded.
<VAISC4> Isolation Win Point criteria.  An Isolation Win Point is awarded to any VEX AI Team that ends 
the Isolation Period with all of the following tasks completed:
1. At least nine (9) Blocks of the Team’s color are Scored.
2. At least three (3) different Goals include at least one Scored (1) Block of the Team’s color.
3. Neither Robot is contacting the Park Zone barrier.
Rule Modifications: Game
<VAIG1> Standard game rules apply.  All <Gx> and <Sx> rules apply as written. All other rules apply as 
written, except for those V5 rules that are modified below or by VEX U rules.
Note: All references assume that the terms “Autonomous Period” and “Driver Controlled Period ” are 
replaced with “Isolation Period” and “Interaction Period”, respectively.
<VAIG2> Autonomous means “no humans.”  As noted by <GG12>, Drive Team Members are not 
permitted to interact with their Robots in any way while they are operating autonomously (i.e., during the 
entirety of a VAIRC Match). The following exceptions are permitted:
a. Using a V5 Controller to disable a Robot which is engaging in reckless or unsafe behavior, with the 
Head Referee’s permission. Robots which are Disabled may not be re-enabled for the rest of the 
Match.
 
<VAIG3> Teams are responsible for the actions of their Robots.  Just as V5RC and VURC Teams 
are responsible for the actions of their Robots during the Autonomous Period, VAIRC Teams are 
responsible for the actions of their Robots throughout the entirety of a VAIRC Match. Excessive or 
egregious Violations of the following rules may result in a Major Violation / Disqualification , as well as the 
Head Referee directing a Team to Disable their Robot:
             
116
VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back - Game Manual
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
a. <GG14> - Don’t destroy other Robots
b. <GG17> - No Holding for more than a 3-count
c. <SG7> - Don’t cross the Autonomous Line, and don’t interfere with your opponents’ actions.
In the context of this rule, “excessive or egregious” refers to a Violation or interaction that the Head 
Referee has judged to be out of the Robot’s control and/or is not showing any signs of improvement. 
Examples may include, but are not limited to:
 ● Holding an opponent for 15+ seconds
 ● Repeated Violations of <SG7> across multiple Matches
  
<VAIG4> Different expansion.  In addition to the expanded sizes described in rules <SG2> and <VUG2>, 
each VAIRC Robot may also extend up to 3’ vertically during the Match to provide expanded visual 
perspectives for Robots within the following conditions:
a. Any extensions or combinations of extensions above 22” for the 15” Robot or above 24” for the 24” 
Robot must fit within a vertical cylinder 2” in diameter, with the exception that one camera or vision 
sensor per Robot may be attached to the top of the vertical extension.
b. This expanded vertical extension cannot be used to manipulate, lift, contain, or move Blocks.
c. This vertical extension rotates with the Robot, and it should not be considered a Violation if an 
extended Robot accidentally tips over during a Match.
 
<VAIG5> Different availability of Loaders. In VAIRC head-to-head Matches, Blocks can only be added 
to Loaders when they must be reintroduced after leaving the Field (see rule <SG4>). This rule takes 
precedence over the guidance in rules <SG9> and <VUG3>.

Rule Modifications: Robot Skills Challenge
<VAIRS1> Standard rules from the V5RC and VURC sections of the game manual apply in most cases, 
unless otherwise specified in this section or when V5RC rules are modified in the VURC section.
 
<VAIRS2> Rule <VURS3> applies as written, and VAIRC Teams are permitted to use two Robots in their 
Robot Skills Matches.
 
<VAIRS3> VAIRC Robot Skills Matches use the same tape lines as VAIRC and V5RC head-to-head 
Matches, but a revised Field layout as shown below. VAIRC Skills Fields are required to use the set of 
four (4) Push Back graphic field tiles.

118

Version 2.2 - Released December 4, 2025
<VAIRS4> A 24” Robot in a VAIRC Robot Skills Match begins the Match in a Parked position in the blue 
Park Zone. A 15” Robot in a VAIRC Robot Skills Match begins the Match in a Parked position in the red 
Park Zone. Robots do not begin the Match with Preloads.
 
<VAIRS5> In VAIRC Robot Skills Matches, Blocks can be added to Loaders by Robots. Blocks cannot be 
added to Loaders by Drive Team Members.
 
<VAIRS6> Blocks that leave the Field during a VAIRC Robot Skills Match must remain outside the Field 
for the remainder of the Match, and cannot be reintroduced.
 
<VAIRS7> Scoring VAIRC Robot Skills Matches. For each VAIRC Robot Skills Match, Teams are awarded 
a score based on the following rules and scoring table:
a. The Team will receive points for one color of Block per Goal, determined by which color represents 
the majority of Blocks Scored in that Goal at the end of the Match (e.g., if there are 7 red Blocks and 
5 blue Blocks in a Long Goal, the Team will only receive points for the red Blocks). If an equal number 
of red and blue Blocks is Scored in a Goal, none of those Blocks will receive points.
b. The Team will receive points for each Bullseye with one or more Blocks at least partially within its 
vertical projection at the end of the Match. (See Figure VAIRS7-1.) Blocks that are deemed “too close 
to call” by the referee should be counted as being within the vertical projection.
c. The Team will receive points for each blue Block that ends the Match in one of the Loaders adjacent 
to the blue Park Zone, and for each red Block that ends the Match in one of the Loaders adjacent to 
the red Park Zone (up to six per Loader).
i. A Loader that ends the Match containing six Blocks that match the color of the adjacent Park 
Zone will receive additional points.
d. The Team will earn points for a Parked Robot as follows:
i. A 24” Robot can only use the red Park Zone, and must meet all criteria of rule <SC4> at the end of 
the Match.
ii. A 15” Robot can only use the blue Park Zone, and must meet all criteria of rule <SC4> at the end 
of the Match.
e. Control Zones and Control Bonuses are not considered in VAIRC Skills Matches.

Rule Modifications: Tournament
<VAIT1> The following VURC rules apply as written: 
 ● <VUT1> - Matches are played 1-Team vs 1-Team, with two Robots each.
 ● <VUT2> - Qualification Matches  are a 1v1 version of a standard V5RC tournament.
 ● <VUT3> - Elimination Matches  are a 1v1 version of a standard V5RC tournament.
 ● <VUT7> - Numbers of Teams in Elimination Matches .
 
The following VURC rules apply, replacing the terms “ Autonomous Period ” and “Driver Controlled 
Period” with “Isolation Period ” and “Interaction Period ”, respectively:
 
 ● <VUT4> - The Isolation Period is 15 seconds. The option to end the Isolation Period early is available 
by default if both Teams and the Head Referee agree, and does not need to be established during 
the event meeting.
 ● <VUT5> - The Interaction Period is one minute 45 seconds. Teams have the option to signal that 
they wish to end the Interaction Period early. Both Teams and the Head Referee must all agree on 
the “early stop.” This is not a requirement, and the option is available in all Matches by default.
 
<VAIT2> VEX AI Robotics Competition Teams may consist of Students that fall into one of the following 
categories. This rule takes precedence over rule <VUT6>.
a. High School Students, as described by the definition of Student. This includes Middle School 
Students who are “playing up” and competing as High School Students.
b. Post-secondary Students, as defined by rule <VUT6>.
Note: The same Team may not consist of Students that fall into both categories (i.e., a blended High 
School and University Team).
  
<VAIT3> Each Student may only participate on one (1) VAIRC Team in a given season. However, a VAIRC 
Student can also be a member of a V5RC or VURC Team in the same season.
Note: See <VAIRM3> for more details regarding how this rule pertains to Robots.

Rule Modifications: Robot
<VAIRM1> All <VURx> rules apply as written. All <Rx> rules apply as written, except for those modified 
below or by <VURx> rules.  
<VAIRM2> Any components used for AI vision processing, such as those found in the VEX AI kit (276- 
8983), are considered standard Additional Electronics  and must abide by <VUR12> as written.
<VAIRM3> VAIRC Teams may also participate in the V5RC or VURC programs. Robots used in 
those programs can be used as-is or modified for use in the VAIRC program provided they pass all 
VAIRC inspection rules, and the Students on the VAIRC Team are the same as on the V5RC or VURC 
counterpart Team.
The intent of this rule is to allow Teams who compete in both programs to potentially utilize the same 
Robots and/or subsystems. In other words, <R1> does not “cross programs.”
Teams participating in both programs should be aware that this does not grant any exemption from any 
rules that might differ between programs. For example, the motor limit that is removed in VAIRC still 
applies for Teams and Robots participating in a V5RC event.

Field Specifications Introduction
This section will outline the specifications that are most important to Teams designing a Robot to 
compete in VEX V5 Robotics Competition Push Back. Though many of the critical dimensions are included 
in this section, it may be necessary to consult the separate assembly guide and 3D CAD models of the 
Field for an additional level of detail. If you can’t find a dimension in the specifications, we include a full 
model of the field to “virtually” measure whatever dimension is necessary.
Field components may vary slightly from event to event. This is to be expected; Teams will need to adapt 
accordingly. It is good design practice to create mechanisms capable of accommodating variances in the 
Field and Blocks.
Note: Minor Field repairs are permissible, provided that the repairs do not affect gameplay. 
Examples of minor Field repairs include (but are not limited to) threadlocker applied to Field 
Element mounting hardware. Be sure to check the Official Q&A for specific examples or to get an 
official clarification.
